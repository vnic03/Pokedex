My name is\nJaret Sypert\n, I go by\nBlizz\nonline. I began playing VGC in early 2020 when I stumbled upon\nWolfe Glick\u2019s Pokemon Academy videos\nand was immediately hooked. I have always been fascinated by the sheer complexity of the game, it feels like a never ending puzzle. This is the story on how I finished\n16th\nat the\n2023 Fort Wayne Regional Championships\n.\nGoing into this event I was not confident in myself at all. I had not performed well in any tournament in a long time, I was not really keeping up with the game leading up to the event and thus I was really contemplating on canceling my trip and refunding my entry. However, before I could finalize my decision the refund date had already passed, so reluctantly I decided to just go. I\u2019d like to preface this next segment by stating I did\nNOT\nhave any part in putting together the six I brought to the tournament, all credit goes to\nJoseph Ugarte\n.\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nI\u2019ve never been one to build my own teams so when it came time to figure out what I wanted to use for this event I began to speak with my friend\nJuan Manuel Santizo\n(\nTekaVGC\n) about what to use and he suggested that I use\nJoseph Ugarte\u2019s Charlotte team\nfrom the weekend prior.\nI was surprised to see that his team still was doing well because in my little spurts of playing VGC in the time leading up to the event I was using an earlier version of his team built by\nNavjit Joshi\n(\nIsAStarter\n). I enjoyed using it, however I wasn\u2019t sure how it was going to hold up against the developed metagame. So I quickly decided that this team would be the one because I was most comfortable with it and had the most experience with it.\nWhen I was figuring out what changes (if any) and how I wanted to train my Pok\u00e9mon for the event I discussed with my friend\nEzequiel Cordero\n(\nZekromZeke\n) on what I wanted to do. He suggested that I change Snarl for\nExtreme Speed\non Arcanine because Snarl is mainly only for the Psychic spam matchup and, with four new Dark types being added to the format, people may be a little hesitant to bring Psychic spam, and with me already having Kingambit and Amoonguss on the team, the matchup was manageable still.\nZeke also suggested that I change the Tera Type on Kingambit to\nFire\nto improve the Lilligant + Torkoal matchup and vs Flutter Mane + Chi-Yu. I thought it was a good change since I never found good use for Flying Tera Type out of all my time using the team.\nThese are the only changes that I made to the original team.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nKingambit\n@ Assault Vest\nAbility: Defiant\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 244 HP / 196 Atk / 12 Def / 20 SpD / 36 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Iron Head\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Assurance\n\u2013 Tera Blast\nKingambit is used on this team to deter the opponent from bringing Arcanine, used as an answer to Flutter Mane, key in the Psychic spam matchup as well as the Lilligant + Torkoal matchup, and used as general offense. Fire Tera Type was used to gain\nimmunity to Will-O-Wisp\n, gain access to a super effective way to hit Amoonguss, and gain resistances against Fairy and Fire.\nOffensive calcs\n196+ Atk Kingambit\nAssurance (Doubled BP)\nvs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Indeedee-F: 210-248 (118.6 \u2013 140.1%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDeffensive calcs\n252 SpA Iron Bundle\nHydro Pump\nvs. 244 HP / 20 SpD Assault Vest Tera Fire Kingambit: 134-162 (65 \u2013 78.6%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nSpA Glimmora\nEarth Power\nvs. 244 HP / 20 SpD Assault Vest Kingambit: 84-100 (40.7 \u2013 48.5%) \u2014 guaranteed 3HKO\n252\n+\nSpA Armarouge\nArmor Cannon\nvs. 244 HP / 20 SpD Assault Vest Kingambit: 164-194 (79.6 \u2013 94.1%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HK\nAmoonguss\n@ Sitrus Berry\nAbility: Regenerator\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 236 HP / 156 Def / 116 SpD\nBold Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Pollen Puff\n\u2013 Rage Powder\n\u2013 Spore\n\u2013 Protect\nThe true MVP of the team. Amoonguss is used as general support with Spore to disrupt opponents. Amoonguss is a key part of the Psychic spam matchup and came in clutch in many of my games. The EV spread is just a standard one I have been using since gen 8. It is optimized for regenerator HP recovery.\nDefensive calcs\n252 SpA Iron Bundle\nFreeze-Dry\nvs. 236 HP / 116 SpD Amoonguss: 122-146 (55.7 \u2013 66.6%) \u2014 guaranteed\n2HKO (3HKO with Sitrus Berry recovery)\n252+ Atk Talonflame\nBrave Bird\nvs. 236 HP / 156+ Def Amoonguss: 164-194 (74.8 \u2013 88.5%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO (Becomes a favorable roll with Sharp Beak, 37% chance to OHKO)\nArcanine\n@ Safety Goggles\nAbility: Intimidate\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 244 HP / 196 Atk / 4 Def / 60 SpD / 4 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Flare Blitz\n\u2013 Will-O-Wisp\n\u2013 Extreme Speed\n\u2013 Protect\nArcanine is used as offense and damage control here. Extreme Speed was very useful for picking up KOs on low HP Pok\u00e9mon and breaking Focus Sashes. Did not see value in giving Arcanine speed since I didn\u2019t think I needed it and I wanted to\nfully commit to bulk and offense\nbecause I did not want to miss any KOs with Extreme Speed. Water Tera Type was used to help against Dondozo and help gain resistances to become even harder to KO.\nMimikyu\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Disguise\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 68 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 20 SpD / 164 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Play Rough\n\u2013 Shadow Sneak\n\u2013 Curse\n\u2013 Protect\nWhile I did not bring Mimikyu much, it is my main Dondozo answer by using\nCurse\nand that is pretty much all it is used for, I could have brought it against the few stall teams that I played against but I felt more comfortable leaving it on the bench. The spread is just to make it as offensive as possible, outspeeds base 135 Pok\u00e9mon at -1 as a benchmark, and the rest of the EVs went into Life Orb HP optimization and general bulk.\nIron Bundle\n@ Booster Energy\nAbility: Quark Drive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 60 HP / 4 Def / 188 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Freeze-Dry\n\u2013 Hydro Pump\n\u2013 Icy Wind\n\u2013 Protect\nIron Bundle is used as a fast offensive water with speed control. The EV spread was given to me by\nDiego de la Vega\n(\nmachin1404\n) and it was very effective.\nIt is built to survive +2 196+ Atk Sucker Punch from Kingambit\nas well as have good odds to be 3HKOd by Arcanine\u2019s Extreme Speed.\nDefensive calcs\n252\n+\nAtk Arcanine\nExtreme Speed\nvs. 60 HP / 4 Def Iron Bundle: 40-48 (28.7 \u2013 34.5%) \u2014 5.6% chance to 3HKO\n+2 196+ Atk\nKingambit\nSucker Punch\nvs. 60 HP / 4 Def Iron Bundle: 117-138 (84.1 \u2013 99.2%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nGreat Tusk\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGround\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Headlong Rush\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Ice Spinner\n\u2013 Protect\nGreat Tusk is used as a general offensive piece. Pretty standard moveset and spread. Ice Spinner was incredibly useful in removing Psychic Terrain.\nTournament run\nOn the morning of the tournament I woke up before there was even light outside at 5:00 am. Not feeling particularly excited nor nervous for the day, I binged YouTube until about 6:30 then got ready for the day and went to eat breakfast. I didn\u2019t eat too much since I typically never eat breakfast, which looking back was a bad idea because lunch break wasn\u2019t until round 5 and the rounds were very long due to so many people using stall teams. Anyways, I headed to the venue to be bored for 30 minutes while I waited for round 1 to start and my friends to arrive.\nThis was my run at\nFort Wayne Regionals\n!\nSwiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nW\nColby Amweg\n(Colby)\nR2\nW\nBrandon Wright\n(\nBrandon\n)\nR3\nL\nCollin Beer\n(Collin)\nR4\nW\nTyler Burdine\n(Tyler)\nR5\nW\nAlex Sawczyn\n(Alex)\nR6\nL\nKody Phelps\n(\nProfKoji\n)\nR7\nW\nGwenn Cox\n(Gwenn)\nR8\nW\nKyle Timbrook\n(Kyle)\nR9\nW\nMarcos Perez\n(\nMoxieBoosted\n)\nNotes\nR3\nR6\nR7\nR8\nR9\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR3\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR3\nL\nCollin Beer\n(Collin)\nThis team was wild,\nSandy Shocks\nwas incredibly difficult to deal with because of the grass tera. I got smashed G3 because I led Arcanine into Indeedee Palafin, gave them the free switch into Hawlucha and from there they clicked\nSwords Dance\nfollowed up by\nAcrobatics\nand got the clean W.\nR6\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR6\nL\nKody Phelps\n(\nProfKoji\n)\nToo afraid of them bringing Annihilape and I played too passively in G2.\nR7\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR7\nW\nGwenn Cox\n(Gwenn)\nGwenn was the most entertaining person I met all day, she unfortunately had a teamsheet error that made her Flutter Mane have no item.\nR8\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR8\nW\nKyle Timbrook\n(Kyle)\nWas very perplexed when I saw them bring out Tinkaton since it was incredibly weak to intimidate as well Great Tusk\u2019s Headlong Rush and it didn\u2019t hit my team for a lot of damage. Was about to lose G3 but I made a good read involving a switch out.\nR9\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR9\nW\nMarcos Perez\n(\nMoxieBoosted\n)\nThis was by far the most back and forth set of VGC I have ever played, wish I could remember all the details but it was a great match. Marcos misplayed in game 3 by clicking\nJet Punch\nwith Wo-Chien on the field and due to its ability, it prevented Palafin from getting the KO on my Kingambit and it won me the game. Wish it didn\u2019t have to go down like that but that\u2019s VGC sometimes.\nAfter I turned in the slip for round 9 I found a corner in the venue and cried. Going into this year I was in a really low period in my life. I was very upset with a lot of things outside of the game and I really didn\u2019t expect to accomplish anything within the game, I was really contemplating quitting because it all just felt like a massive waste of time to me, so this one really means a lot. I had not even thought about day 2 until Zeke messaged me wishing me luck in day 2. I was so happy to make it into day 2, at that point I couldn\u2019t have cared less if I went 0-5 in day 2.\nWoke up at 7:00AM, quickly got ready for the day, packed up my luggage, ate a big breakfast this time, and went to the venue. Hung out with my bro\nKylan Van Severen\n(\nPsychedVGC\n) until round 10 started.\nDay 2 Swiss Rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nW\nTyler Coleman\n(\nShinyUmbreon\n)\nR11\nW\nNicholas Borghi\n(\nBorghi\n)\nR12\nW\nBobby Rochelle\n(\nBobby\n)\nR13\nL\nJoseph Ugarte\n(\nJoeUX9\n)\nR14\nL\nThaison Hughes\n(\ncharisma\n)\nNotes\nR10\nR11\nR13\nR14\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR10\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nW\nTyler Coleman\n(\nShinyUmbreon\n)\nFelt good to start the day off with a win. This, alongside the set against Marcos were the closest all tournament by far. In G3 my Iron Bundle double missed\nIcy Wind\nagainst low HP Flutter Mane and Baxcalibur, I thought it was over but apparently Iron Bundle can live an\nIce Shard\n+ tera water\nJet Punch\ndown from 70HP to 2HP.\nR11\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR11\nW\nNicholas Borghi\n(\nBorghi\n)\nGot a good read off of him T1 of G3, ended up getting extremely lucky with freezing his Amoonguss and critting it as well. Funnily enough he was the first person all tournament to actually know who I was.\nR13\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR13\nL\nJoseph Ugarte\n(\nJoeUX9\n)\nWhen I was walking to my match I overheard Joe say \u201cBro I\u2019m playing against my own team\u201d just thought that was funny. Anyways I knew this was going to be a very hard match. I got too aggressive in game 1 and game 2 Joe put on his hoodie and outplayed me very badly. It was nice getting to meet Joe.\nR14\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR14\nL\nThaison Hughes\n(\ncharisma\n)\nHonestly was not sure how to feel going into this match knowing that if I won I would likely make the Top 8. Looking back it still is so crazy to me that I came that close though. We were right about to get started when the judge came and told us that we would be playing on stream so I had to quickly pack up all my things and in my haste I forgot my notebook so that kind of upset me. Was not sure how I felt playing on stream. In the end I lost but it was still a good set, and I am content with the result. Fun Fact: I did not know Ting-Lu was a Ground type and only found out during this match.\nYou can watch my\nRound 14 set\nvs Thaison Hughes\nhere\n!\nClosing thoughts\nI could never have accomplished this had it not been for the overwhelming amount of\nsupport\nI had over the weekend, there are just too many of you to thank but I appreciate every single one of you more than you ever could imagine whether it be in person or online. I am extremely satisfied with my result at my first ever regional and first event as a master.\nAs for the team I do not think it will hold up very well in the constantly evolving metagame for too long so use with caution!\nThank you\nfor reading!\nYou might also like...\nStream details and caster lineup for Bologna Special Event have been announced!\nThe last event of the season in Europe is streamed on 1\u20132 June, with Charlie Merriman, Jamie Boyt, Lee Provost and Markus Stadter as casters.\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez\n28 May, 2024\nDavid Rodr\u00edguez is the 2024 Mexico City Special Event Champion!\n2024 LAIC semifinalist David Rodr\u00edguez has won his fourth Special Event title!
