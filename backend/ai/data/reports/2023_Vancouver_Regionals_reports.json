The name\u2019s\nAbdullah Mohayyuddin\n, also known as\nsempra\n. I\u2019m a 17-year-old VGC player based in Canada, and if you\u2019ve heard my name before it was likely through online tours or draft leagues. I was a purely online player before\nVancouver\n, and I\u2019m so happy I got to experience the real-life circuit. I\u2019ve been playing VGC for about\n10 months\nand I\u2019ve watched the game for about twice as long. I\u2019m so excited to share my thoughts on the team I brought to\nwin\nVancouver 2023\n!\nBefore I begin, I want to give a giant shoutout to\nNick Navarre\n(\nNails\n), who was the original creator of the team. His team report is public and I urge anyone considering running this team to first check his report out on\nAdi Subramanian\n\u2019s (\nck49\n)\nYouTube channel\n:\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding\nComing into\nRegulation Set B\n, I felt very uncertain about the format. I had just come off an impressive 2 months in\nRegulation Set A\nwith high placements in both online tours and draft tournaments with dozens of different teams, but in Regulation Set B nothing was sticking. I felt very lost as I bounced around so many archetypes. Just weeks before Vancouver, I was confident I would bring one of Talonflame + Great Tusk (either\nEmilio Forbes\n\u2018s\nversion\nor\nYotam Cohen\n,\nToler Webb\n&\nJustin Carris\n\u2018s\nversion\n), Volcarona set-up (\nKyle Livinghouse\n\u2019s\nteam\n), or Palafin balance cores. The reality was, I felt awful on everything.\nThat\u2019s when\nCalvin Foster\n(\ncalvonix\n) reached out to me. In his preparation for\nPerth\n, he sent me what would be pretty much his exact\npaste\na week before the tour. Looking at the team, I didn\u2019t quite understand it, it felt odd putting\nTorkoal\non what was such a fast and offensive team. After his great placement, this style of team was on my radar, but it took\nKnoxville\nto realize that this was the team. I also want to take this section to apologize to Calvin. On stream I called his team trash when what I meant to say was that I didn\u2019t initially understand it but I would later come to find out the true strength of Torkoal; I was just so overwhelmed after the Regional to process what I was saying\u2026 oops.\nNails had come off an\namazing placement in\nKnoxville\n, even through a tough time. It was just a couple days before\nVancouver\n, and at this point I was so confused on what I would bring I decided to give it a spin. It took a day of laddering to realize Nick had created something amazing. The team was constructed masterfully and after watching his report on Adi\u2019s channel, I was locked in. This team had the perfect combination of exactly what I wanted in my previous teams:\nhyper offense\nto make the offensive reads I preferred over defensive ones, an\nunbreakable backbone\nof Dragonite and Kingambit that turned this team from frail to a tank, and, the best part,\nset up was literally unneeded\nas Torkoal set up the whole team just by existing. It was perfect.\nI now guide you to the\nvideo\nwhere Nick goes into incredible detail on the team. It would be disingenuous to give anything but thoughts on the team since Nails has done such an amazing job on talking about his process of building already. I made three hilariously tiny\nchanges\n:\nPower Gem\n> Icy Wind on\nFlutter Mane\n. This helped with the small Arcanine issue the team has, as well as constantly pressuring Volcarona teams. This change would help me win finals as my opponent was pressured to Terastallize his Arcanine, letting me get the KO with a predicted Moonblast. I honestly don\u2019t think either is better or worse, it just depends on how you play.\nI\nadded one point of Speed\non\nDragonite\n. I couldn\u2019t tell you if this made a difference, but after seeing so many Dragonite with 60 Speed EVs, there\u2019s a chance.\nSteel Tera Type\n> Ground Tera Type on\nGreat Tusk\n. This is the change I\u2019m most proud of, as it helps you most importantly with the Talonflame + Tyranitar matchup, as Steel-Tera Type Great Tusk essentially walls these two Pok\u00e9mon. This Tera Type can also save end games vs Booster Energy Iron Bundle and Flutter Mane who get a Speed boost from your own Sun.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nBreakthrough\n(Torkoal)\u00a0@ Charcoal\nAbility: Drought\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD\nQuiet Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Eruption\n\u2013 Flamethrower\n\u2013 Earth Power\n\u2013 Protect\nThe heart and soul of this team.\nTorkoal\nof course sets up the Sun for the rest of the team with its Drought. This Torkoal is very standard: Fire Tera Type-boosted Eruption does disgusting damage even to resisted hits, and the\nturtle\nis quite resilient, surviving so many neutral and super effective attacks.\nTorkoal on this team is very special compared to many teams of this style, taking up its very own slot as an incredibly\npowerful special attacker\n. This Torkoal works in conjunction with Lilligant to blow up teams on its own, and with other Pok\u00e9mon such as Flutter Mane to threaten 150 base power Eruptions if you don\u2019t respect it.\nTT\n(Lilligant)\u00a0@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Chlorophyll\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Sleep Powder\n\u2013 Leaf Storm\n\u2013 After You\n\u2013 Protect\nLilligant\n: the queen herself. Lilligant is so unbelievably powerful and disrespected that a whole team report can be made on her on its own. Lilligant was an unbelievably\nsmart call\nNails made as many teams just don\u2019t have a matchup into it. Lilligant is deceivingly powerful too, outspeeding and KO\u2019ing Booster Energy Iron Bundle even at -2.\nI\u2019d like to reference Nails\u2019s\nreport\nwhere he said that people had the uninformed belief that Lilligant + Torkoal required reads and predictions to play properly, and as the second person to say it, this could not be so hilariously far from the truth.\nAfter You + Eruption go brrr\n.\nFunny enough, you don\u2019t even have to click\nSleep Powder\nto win, I used it 8 times in all 17 rounds with 5 being the singular set on the top 4 streamed match.\nOffensive calcs\n-2\n252 SpA Lilligant\nLeaf Storm\nvs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Iron Bundle: 150-176 (114.5 \u2013 134.3%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nFANCY\n(Flutter Mane) @ Choice Specs\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 20 HP / 84 Def / 196 SpA / 4 SpD / 204 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Moonblast\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Power Gem\nThe GOAT. The Muhammad Ali of\n\u2018Mons\n, the Jordan of\n\u2018Mons\n, the Serena Williams of\n\u2018Mons\n. This Pok\u00e9mon is the most broken Pok\u00e9mon in the entire format and I refuse to play a team without this thing.\nFlutter Mane\nis just disgusting on this team, the option to nuke with Fairy Tera Type-, Choice Specs- and Protosynthesis-boosted Moonblasts is just not fair. If you\u2019re running this team, I would recommend looking at calcs specifically for that nuke, the amount of people that don\u2019t know these calcs brings tears to my eyes as I OHKO their Garganacl.\nOffensive calcs\n196+ SpA Choice Specs Protosynthesis Tera-Fairy Flutter Mane\nMoonblast\nvs. 252 HP / 116+ SpD Garganacl: 202-238 (97.5 \u2013 114.9%) \u2014 81.3% chance to OHKO\n196+ SpA Choice Specs Protosynthesis Tera-Fairy Flutter Mane\nMoonblast\nvs. 252 HP / 0 SpD\nTera-Ground\nBaxcalibur: 260-308 (117.1 \u2013 138.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n196+ SpA Choice Specs Protosynthesis Tera-Fairy Flutter Mane\nMoonblast\nvs. 252 HP / 0 SpD\nTera-Flying\nRoaring Moon: 228-270 (107.5 \u2013 127.3%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nTrouble\n(Great Tusk) @ Choice Scarf\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Headlong Rush\n\u2013 Earthquake\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Rock Slide\nGreat Tusk\nis such a strong end-game Pok\u00e9mon, and Choice Scarf + built-in \u201cLife Orb\u201d is just ridiculous. There were very few games I didn\u2019t bring this Pok\u00e9mon and it served me so well as a ridiculous nuke as well as a very underrated switch-in. I felt very comfortable with eating physical hits, even super effective ones, and this Pok\u00e9mon would retaliate with OHKO\u2019s on so many neutral hits.\nJolly\nallows it to outspeed even fast Tyranitar in Tailwind as well as Baxcalibur on\nJoji Kaieda\n&\nRinya Kobayashi\n\u2018s\n\u201cRinya Monsters\u201d\u00a0team\n.\nEspresso\n(Dragonite)\u00a0@ Lum Berry\nAbility: Multiscale\nTera Type:\nFlying\nEVs: 180 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 68 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Tera Blast\n\u2013 Ice Spinner\n\u2013 Extreme Speed\n\u2013 Protect\nDragonite\nis so incredibly strong and with Multiscale you eat 4-times effective Ice-type moves like it\u2019s no one\u2019s business. I still can\u2019t believe people don\u2019t see the strength of this Pok\u00e9mon as it boasts one of the highest Day 2 turnouts of any Pok\u00e9mon this generation. Flying-Tera Type Tera Blast, being a STAB of 2 off a max Attack thanks to Terastallization, means you absorb hits with Multiscale and then chuuunk threats.\nDragonite is irreplaceable in my opinion as many people have asked. The combination of Extreme Speed, its terrain countering and Multiscale is so solid off a decently fast Pok\u00e9mon. I also preferred Protect over Tailwind as did Nails, as your Lilligant + Torkoal core being the only two Pok\u00e9mon with Protect can make matchups very difficult, much more than the niche situations getting Tailwind up helps.\nHOT\n(Kingambit) @ Assault Vest\nAbility: Defiant\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 252 HP / 196 Atk / 4 Def / 52 SpD / 4 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Kowtow Cleave\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Iron Head\n\u2013 Tera Blast\nI was so surprised as to how strong this Pok\u00e9mon is.\nKingambit\nfills so many roles on this team that it comes to so many matchups. Kingambit is your designated Arcanine check, Armarouge check, Tailwind check, Trick Room check, etc.\nKingambit\u2019s\nFire Tera Type\n, another brilliant call by Nails, allows you to effectively wall much of the hard Trick Room core, as well as making your opponent double guess using Will-o-Wisp on it. Fire Tera Type is so strong as Kingambit survives Headlong Rush from Great Tusk, so there are situations I\u2019d even Terastallize there. (Do note that this is without Protosynthesis boost: make sure you don\u2019t screw up your own calcs by forgetting the boosts on the opponents team!)\nHow to use the team\nCommon leads\nI had three common leads that I used in around 90% of the games I played.\nCommon leads\nComments\n+\nClassic\nLilligant + Torkoal\nneeds no intro. This style of playing is the core of this team. After You + Eruption, Sleep Powder, setting up Sun for your Sun abusers, the whole 9 yards. This lead is the team in a nutshell.\n+\n\u201cXernDon\u201d\nFlutter Mane + Torkoal\nis the core that truly drew me to this type of team. Fairy Tera Type-boosted Moonblast is a nuke, OHKOing Water-Tera Type Baxcalibur, Flying-Tera Type Roaring Moon, and even having a favourable roll at OHKOing some Garganacl. This core works so well together because very few Pok\u00e9mon can OHKO Flutter Mane, forcing your opponent to double it while also taking a huge Eruption from a full-HP Torkoal. This mode has very few checks and, along with Lilligant + Torkoal, this can make for an unwinnable switch-up.\n+\n/\nImmovable object\nThe defensive core of\nDragonite + either Kingambit or Great Tusk\nis unbreakable for so many teams. This core generally works to stall means of speed control, such as Tailwind and Trick Room, preserving the frailer Pok\u00e9mon in the back to clean up. I brought this core just as much as I brought Lilligant + Torkoal, and this is probably the least expected core on team selection. Your opponents are usually leading something to play around Lilligant + Torkoal and leading this tank core completely throws off their positioning and game plan.\nCommon matchups\nNow, this is how to play against some common matchups.\nMatchup\nComments\nTrick Room teams\nOption 1: Lead\nDragonite + Kingambit\n, with Torkoal and Flutter Mane in the back\nOption 2: Lead\nDragonite + Flutter Mane\n, with Torkoal and Kingambit in the back\nTrick Room is a very\nfavourable\nmatchup for this team. In general,\nDragonite + Fire-Tera Type Kingambit\nis unbreakable. You can Ice Spinner away the Psychic Terrain, are slower than Armarouge with Kingambit, and the double priority haunts Torkoal who is already doing no damage to the Multiscale Dragon type and Assault Vest Fire type. Of course, Torkoal goes crazy under their Trick Room, but it\u2019s much harder to position it correctly.\nThe major tips I can give in this matchup is to lead\nDragonite + Flutter Mane\non mix-ups as this counters very likely counterplay, such as Hatterene leads, Iron Hands leads, and more. Also, if Indeedee is not on the field, try your best to not use priority if you can because Trick Room players love catching you using priority on the Indeedee switch. Sometimes Trick Room players rely on this common misplay to steal the win. Always use regular priority if you can afford it.\nTailwind Talonflame teams\nLead\nDragonite + Great Tusk\n, with Kingambit and Flutter Mane in the back\nTailwind is definitely a\nweaker\nmatchup for this team. Thankfully priority Tailwind is on a decline, but the still common Talonflame + Tyranitar core can prove to be miserable if you don\u2019t play it right. Generally the gameplan is to stall with Dragonite + another Pok\u00e9mon, while setting up Flutter Mane to clean. These teams generally have a weakness to Flutter Mane, so preserving that is very strong. Saving\nTerastallization for Great Tusk\nis also a very strong play, as very few members of this core can break Choice Scarf Steel-Tera Type Great Tusk.\nThe\nDragonite + Great Tusk\nlead threatens Extreme Speed + Rock Slide onto Talonflame turn 1. If the lead is unfavourable, swap Great Tusk into Kingambit and go from there. Watch below\nmy Game 1 battle\nvs\nCollin Heier\nto see this play out perfectly!\nPalafin balance teams\nLead\nTorkoal + Flutter Mane\n, with Great Tusk and either Dragonite or Kingambit in the back\nThis is a matchup that this team excels in. Simply put, abusing the fact that Palafin needs to swap turn 1 makes this matchup so, so\nfavourable\n. You can normally lead\nTorkoal + Flutter Mane\n, use Eruption + Fairy Tera Type-boosted Dazzling Gleam, and pick up 1 or 2 knockouts. The Sun makes Palafin nearly useless, and the general core of these types of teams happen to be weak to Flutter Mane. This is where knowing your Fairy Tera Type- and Protosynthesis-boosted Moonblast calcs is useful, as knowing that you can just nuke a slot is extremely helpful.\nCommon threats\nThe following are some tough Pok\u00e9mon or archetypes to play against.\nThreat\nComments\nFocus Sash Flutter Mane\nThe combination of\nFocus Sash\nand the fact that these Pok\u00e9mon get Speed boosts under your own Sun can prove deadly. A well-positioned Flutter Mane will sweep, and nukes don\u2019t work as they\u2019ll live with Focus Sash.\nCounterplay:\nPlay around\nKingambit\n. Kingambit takes very little from even Fairy Tera Type-boosted Moonblast on these Flutter Mane. Flutter Mane\u2019s Speed doesn\u2019t matter when priority Sucker Punch is haunting it every turn.\nBooster Energy Iron Bundle\nIn general, most players will save this Pok\u00e9mon till the end of the game. A properly positioned Booster Energy Iron Bundle can be a nightmare, and smarter players will leverage Sun turns and the need for you to Terastallize your leads to sweep with a late-game Iron Bundle.\nCounterplay:\nUse\nTerastallization\nextremely wisely. The majority of the team loves to offensively Terastallize, but this is the matchup where every Terastallization needs to be thought through multiple turns ahead. Consider your defensive options vs this Pok\u00e9mon and use them in abundance.\nTyranitar\nThis Pok\u00e9mon will give you trouble, and you need to keep it in mind. \u201cI\u2019m gonna Close Combat it\u201d is not enough of a game plan, you have to fully invest every turn into saving counterplay for it for later, predicting turns it\u2019ll come out, and using Terastallization conservatively. Tyranitar will mess up your entire game plan if you don\u2019t respect it.\nCounterplay:\nRespect it\n. Don\u2019t lead Lilligant + Torkoal turn 1, and play turns conservatively, as if Tyranitar can come in at any point. If your opponent has Tyranitar on their team sheet, expect it. You have checks and nukes into it such as Great Tusk and Flutter Mane, but Tyranitar puts much of the Sun operation to a pause and, as such, you need to give it the respect it deserves.\nArcanine\nArcanine, especially with Safety Goggles, will sit in your own Sun and OHKO your entire team with Flare Blitz. An unchecked Arcanine can be your biggest enemy and can sit pretty in front of much of your team. You need to dedicate resources and time into taking out Arcanine, because, if you lead badly, this team hates switching out, especially for Arcanine who doesn\u2019t have many switch-ins to begin with.\nCounterplay:\nLeverage around\nyour opponents\u2019 hesitance to lead Arcanine\n. Kingambit getting +1 is a bigger issue for them than an Arcanine will ever be for you. The chance they lead Arcanine is rare, but if they do, capitalize off it. Kingambit with Fire Tera Type is a very strong counter to Arcanine, and if you catch them at +1, you will KO the Arcanine with Kowtow Cleave after Flare Blitz recoil off of someone like your own Flutter Mane. (Make sure Sun isn\u2019t up or you\u2019ll lower your Flutter Mane!)\nTournament run\nThis was my run at\nVancouver Regionals\n!\nDay 1 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nNoah Ridgway\n(DAMN0AH)\nR2\nWLW\nSean Wen\n(\nHegna\n)\nR3\nWW\nJing Zhou\n(Z)\nR4\nWW\nAta Makhdoom\n(Pok\u00e9MonSt\u00ebr)\nR5\nWW\nGalo Orbea\n(\nEcuaDude\n)\nR6\nWW\nCollin Heier\n(\nCrown\n)\nR7\nWW\nGavin Michaels\n(\nHUH?!!\n)\nR8\nWW\nLogan Mazur\n(\nLogan\n)\nR9\nWW\nShreyas Radhakrishna\n(\nShreyas\n)\nNotes\nR1 to R5\nR6\nR7\nR8 and R9\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR1 to R5\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nNoah Ridgway\n(DAMN0AH)\nR2\nWLW\nSean Wen\n(\nHegna\n)\nR3\nWW\nJing Zhou\n(Z)\nR4\nWW\nAta Makhdoom\n(Pok\u00e9MonSt\u00ebr)\nR5\nWW\nGalo Orbea\n(\nEcuaDude\n)\nI don\u2019t remember too much about my early rounds. I remember playing some tougher matchups like Talonflame + Great Tusk + Tyranitar, but I knew my lines and I was confident. I played a lot of Armarouge for whatever reason, and while that does make bringing Lilligant + Torkoal not an effective strategy, I still brought it on mixups. The strength of a team like this is that you can\ngo easy on the early rounds\nand just\nbank off flow charts\nto win.\nR6\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR6\nWW\nCollin Heier\n(\nCrown\n)\nMy first major challenge of the day. Everyone knows who BattleRoom is, no one knows who sempra is. This truly means nothing in a battle, but the battle started when I saw who my opponent was. It takes a lot to settle yourself and understand that you\u2019re bound to\nplay strong players\n. Turns out, this would also be my streamed match. I sent the link to all my friends and family (as one does) and sat in the chair prepared for the battle.\nMy heart did sink a little realizing the matchup, but I knew my lines. Game 1 was a perfect execution of the\nDragonite + Great Tusk\nlead, showing the threat of Extreme Speed + Rock Slide and then not going for it. Game 2 showed the power of\nSteel-Tera Type Great Tusk\n, making it the ultimate tank. Unfortunately, my Kingambit got frozen on a switch into Freeze-Dry, but Great Tusk was able to clean up after coming back in. This was my worst interview given, I was just so excited and nervous\u2026 don\u2019t check that one out. Also apologies to Collin, in my excitement I completely forgot to go for a handshake.\nYou can watch my\nRound 6\nmatch below, starting on\n5:12:20\n!\nR7\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR7\nWW\nGavin Michaels\n(\nHUH?!!\n)\nThis being my gateway to Day 2 was very scary. Everyone knows Gavin Michaels, the\nprevious winner of the\nVancouver Regionals\nand the\nSV Rain\nGOAT. I knew Gavin\u2019s team before this after watching his stream game and watching him play other strong players, and I knew just how incredible Gavin was. Gavin really makes the best of the best look like stepping stones, and honestly I was more excited than anything to play Gavin on a Sun team of all things.\nThe matchup\nfelt like the Kyogre and Groudon duels\nI was used to in Series 12 of\nSword\n&\nShield\n, and it played very similarly. Gavin had to preserve Pelipper for Azumarill\u2019s strong Aqua Jets, and I had to keep Torkoal for as long as possible even if it was a useless bring just so I didn\u2019t get swept by Azumarill. Game 1 was won off a hard read that Gavin\u2019s Brute Bonnet would Terastallize into Poison type. I Headlong Rushed the slot and was able to win after maneuvering around Torkoal. Game 2 wasn\u2019t as easy, Gavin had stalled perfectly, statusing and chipping the majority of my Pok\u00e9mon to create the ultimate Azumarill playground. One by one Gavin swept my team with his final two of Pelipper and Azumarill, until I barely took out Azumarill. It was now 1v1, my Torkoal in Sun vs his Pelipper. The issue was that Gavin had to hit 2 out of 2 Hydro Pumps, otherwise I was 2HKOing him. I got very lucky and avoided one of the Hydro Pumps and was spared a Game 3.\nR8 and R9\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR8\nWW\nLogan Mazur\n(\nLogan\n)\nR9\nWW\nShreyas Radhakrishna\n(\nShreyas\n)\nI was in cut at this point! I had just gotten off a call with my parents explaining that\nI would be Day 2 no matter what\n, and their happiness made my night. Nevertheless, I tried my best as your Day 1 score will greatly impact how easy your second day is. In these rounds, I played hard Trick Room twice and my flow charts worked just as well. I learned in these two rounds just how much Armarouge + Indeedee players need you to mess up and click priority on their Indeedee switch-in, and I was tested probably half a dozen times between the 4 games I played in these 2 rounds. Not falling for it, I took both games 2-0.\nI was\n18-1\u00a0in games\nat this point. I had dinner at a friend\u2019s place and left my group some matchups to look at. I woke up the next day and talked to some friends about more matchups, and I felt confident.\nDay 2 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nWLW\nAaron Zheng\n(\nCybertronVGC\n)\nR11\nWW\nRyan Loseto\n(\nSableyeVGC\n)\nR12\nLL\nNeil Patel\n(\nNeil\n)\nR13\nLL\nDylan Salvanera\n(\nDylan\n)\nR14\nLWW\nGavin Michaels\n(\nHUH?!!\n)\nNotes\nR10\nR11\nR12\nR13\nR14\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR10\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nWLW\nAaron Zheng\n(\nCybertronVGC\n)\nSmall side story!\nI made it to the venue on time but after getting there I didn\u2019t realize you needed to keep your snapped wristband from the day before and almost didn\u2019t get in. Regardless, I was marked as late and I believe they were giving game losses if the opponents agreed to late players. I didn\u2019t receive one, so while Aaron hasn\u2019t confirmed it I\u2019m pretty sure he declined taking a game win. If that doesn\u2019t prove how amazing this man is I don\u2019t know what will.\nThis game was so\nexciting\n. The fanboy in me wanted to play Cybertron win or lose, but the competitor in me was scared about the matchup. I didn\u2019t get too much time to prep vs the\nRinya Monsters\nteam Cybertron was playing, but I felt that my lines vs most Talonflame + Great Tusk would prove useful in this matchup. The issue in the matchup was that if I gave Baxcalibur too much room it could easily run with the game, and of course that Talonflame + Great Tusk is a harder matchup on its own.\nRegardless, in Game 1 I ran the same\nDragonite + Great Tusk\nlead and stalled Tailwind to allow my Flutter Mane to sweep. Game 2 Aaron pulled the cord, playing much sharper and more aggressive to counter the more defensive switch-up I went for. Game 3 I returned to my old lead and missed a crucial Rock Slide on his Talonflame after it got hit with Extreme Speed. Aaron said he didn\u2019t catch it on the team sheet, so it felt better after the set knowing we could play a series that wasn\u2019t decided by a teamsheet miss. Regardless of the miss, I crawled my way up with smarter Terastallization usage from Game 2 to seal the series\n2-1\n.\nR11\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR11\nWW\nRyan Loseto\n(\nSableyeVGC\n)\nThis was a matchup I was happy to pull. You can\u2019t make a team that has perfect matchups into everything, and in Ryan\u2019s case, Torkoal + Lilligant, as obvious and team sheet shouting as it was, was very effective vs him. These games looked similar to our finals games, though I ended up leading my\nXernDon\nFlutter Mane + Torkoal\ncore in Game 2 to take it. Ryan said Terastallization didn\u2019t go off which would\u2019ve won him the game in Game 1, so it was a little unfortunate to take a game like that, but I won the set\n2-0\n.\nR12\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR12\nLL\nNeil Patel\n(\nNeil\n)\nThis was the\nworst matchup\nI could\u2019ve pulled. Neil\u2019s team isn\u2019t something that hard counters Sun in my opinion, it was just something so different and unseen that I had no clue how to go about it. I worked with\nGiovanni Cischke\n(\nPqlarbear\n) and\nCalvin Foster\n(\ncalvonix\n), who both shared their agreement that Lilligant could have a very strong place in the late game.\nThis would work perfectly in Game 1, as I got a 50/50 go in my favour and end up with a low-HP Dondozo with Tatusugiri in its mouth vs my Lilligant and Torkoal in the back. Unfortunately, I got unlucky with misses to lose the end game, which happens when you\u2019re playing Lilligant + Torkoal. In Game 2, I tried to catch Neil on the mix up with a Lilligant + Torkoal lead, but he was unfazed and led perfectly with Glimmora + Dragonite, getting a perfect read that I would After You + Earth Power his Glimmora I chipped with Leaf Storm and setting up Tailwind. I forfeited as I lost my first game\n0-2\n.\nR13\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR13\nLL\nDylan Salvanera\n(\nDylan\n)\nI was\nback on stream\n, being the first streamed game of the day. This matchup was tough, and while I didn\u2019t realize it at the time (I didn\u2019t recognize his real name), Dylan was a very strong long-time player of the game. I was reluctant to lead Lilligant + Torkoal (which I would later learn was kind of my only out vs. this team) because of the last game I had lost to misses. I don\u2019t think I need to talk too much about this game, I got destroyed. The game wasn\u2019t even close and I knew it. This was the first time in the tour I was\nfrustrated with myself\n, not because I lost, but because I let the events of one round carry over into another round. It was stupid of me to not lead Lilligant because of my fear of missing, and I was very disappointed in myself for not playing to my outs.\nYou can watch my\nRound 13\nmatch starting in\n1:03:50\n!\nR14\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR14\nLWW\nGavin Michaels\n(\nHUH?!!\n)\nAt this point, I believe me and Gavin both knew our resistances were both strong enough to make cut. I wanted to win this anyway so I was guaranteed (because you never truly are).\nThis time, I recognized Gavin\u2019s game plan. Gavin needed to chip and status my Pok\u00e9mon to allow Azumarill to take KOs, and he needed to lead\nBrute Bonnet + Mimikyu\nto do so. I didn\u2019t want to make the same hard read I made in Day 1, so I led\nDragonite + Great Tusk\nto allow me to Earthquake + Tera Blast either slot to 1HKO either Pok\u00e9mon. I allowed Game 1 to slip me, Gavin played around his late-game Azumarill very strongly to sweep. I had some new information though, even though Gavin\u2019s supportive Mimikyu set up Trick Room, it was\nstill faster than my Dragonite\n. This was very good for me, as I could effectively swap out my Dragonite slot into Torkoal whenever I was threatened by Azumarill. If Gavin swapped in Pelipper in the same turn, my switch will go second allowing me to get the Sun up.\nI leveraged this to win Game 2, critting Gavin\u2019s Azumarill in the process. I feel like I had the lead, but this just pushed a win instantly.\nGame 3 unfortunately went in my favour RNG wise as well. Gavin stalled his Mimikyu + Brute Bonnet lead very strongly, having Dragonite eat a Lum Berry as well as burning my Great Tusk. He traded huge damage and Terastallization for the double status. The turn after, Gavin Will-o-Wisped my Dragonite and\nmissed\n, keeping Dragonite\u2019s Multiscale and allowing for huge Tera Blasts. Gavin forfeit after this. This miss sealed the game. I felt like I was still in the lead, but this miss made it impossible for Gavin to have a chance.\nI finished Swiss\n12-2\nand locked in\n#1 seed\n.\nEvery single one of my opponents made cut\n, and I played all 3 of the eventual top 4. Cut would prove to be my biggest test, as I would play one of the two top 8 I hadn\u2019t yet played.\nTop Cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nLWW\nDemitrios Kaguras\n(\nDEMITRI\n)\nTop 4\nWLW\nDylan Salvanera\n(\nDylan\n)\nFinals\nWW\nRyan Loseto\n(\nSableyeVGC\n)\nNotes\nTop 8\nTop 4\nFinals\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nTop 8\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nLWW\nDemitrios Kaguras\n(\nDEMITRI\n)\nAnother Tyranitar + Great Tusk + Talonflame team\n. I was very scared, but I knew my plays. Demitrios however also studied his matchup into my team, or at least knew his lines after discussion with him after the set.\nGame 1 I played decently, but Demitrios correctly assessed the threat being the Steel-Tera Type Great Tusk, sacrificing Flutter Mane to\nforce me to Terastallize\nmy Dragonite early. He would sweep the late game with Iron Bundle.\nGame 2 played out similarly. I was forced to Terastallize early, but I took the game after a\nread\ninto the Flying-Tera Type Tyranitar and Rock Sliding it out of the sky.\nGame 3 was the culmination of both of us understanding how we wanted to win. He once again sacrificed his Flutter Mane to my now\nDragonite + Kingambit\nlead, but I had gotten huge damage on his Talonflame for the first time. After Tyranitar came out, I found a very sharp line that allowed me to win most of the time. I could ignore the Talonflame because it was either KOing itself with Brave Bird or Will-o-Wisping my Great Tusk that had swapped in. In either case, I felt confident I could Close Combat + Tera Blast the Tyranitar slot to put it in Tera Blast range for the next turn. Demitrios made a hard read, assuming I would Rock Slide like last game and didn\u2019t Terastallize his Tyranitar. His Talonflame KO\u2019d itself with Brave Bird, and I OHKO\u2019d the Tyranitar that didn\u2019t have a chance to move while my Dragonite sat pretty. Iron Bundle couldn\u2019t win the 1v3, and Demitrios forfeit.\nTop 4\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 4\nWLW\nDylan Salvanera\n(\nDylan\n)\nFor this matchup, I had gotten\nhuge help from Nails\n(the creator of the team) and a couple of his friends as well as my own friends. We had assessed that a\nLilligant + Torkoal\nlead was the strongest lead as Dylan was pretty much forced into leading Roaring Moon. I could go for a Sleep Powder onto the Roaring Moon while swapping in Flutter Mane. After this, After You + Dazzling Gleam spam could just win the game there.\nDylan led off with\nRoaring Moon + Sandy Shocks\nthis time to put great pressure on this lead. I missed my Sleep Powder as Dylan went for Breaking Swipe + Earth Power into a protecting Torkoal. Turn 2 I went for the original plan, Sleep Powdering the Roaring Moon and swapping in Flutter Mane, who ate the Earth Power. I banked on sleep turns in turn 3 since they were favored and I would get an instant win. In hindsight, I could\u2019ve just used After You + Dazzling Gleam, but if Dylan got the one-turn wake into Protect, the matchup would get dicey. I won Game 1.\nGame 2, I took my chances on\nrolls\nand mixed my calcs up, believing somehow that Eruption would OHKO the Tauros. Getting no KO turn 1, it eventually came down to Kingambit KO\u2019ing a low-HP Fairy-Tera Type Sandy Shocks. Kingambit missed the KO, and I haven\u2019t checked if it was a roll because frankly I hit too many Sleep Powders to care.\nGame 3 we went back to our\noriginal leads\n. This time I felt confident Dylan wouldn\u2019t simply Earth Power my Torkoal slot, so I felt much more confident swapping in Flutter Mane turn 1. I hit my Sleep Powder on the Roaring Moon as Sandy Shocks Volt Switched my Lilligant into Iron Bundle. Turn 2 I KO\u2019d Roaring Moon, and turn 3 I Sleep Powder the Sandy Shocks switch-in + Dazzling Gleam as he used Icy Wind, KOing my Lilligant. His Iron Bundle is on Focus Sash HP and his Sandy Shocks is on low HP and asleep. Turn 4 I incorrectly read the Sandy Shocks switch and used Sucker Punch on Iron Bundle. Dylan\u2019s Sandy Shocks took another turn of sleep as my Flutter Mane KO\u2019d it. I played the end game incredibly poorly. Swapping out Flutter Mane won it instantly, but I forgot it was -1. Then I used Sucker Punch instead of Kowtow Cleave on Tauros, which would\u2019ve been -1. Running the calc, the Close Combat never KO\u2019d my Torkoal, but a crit could\u2019ve lost me it if I got the Sucker Punch mind games wrong.\nRegardless, I\nwon my top 4 set\n, and I stared at the\nsilver medal\nthat was set up on display. I would\u2019ve been happy taking either medal home at this point!\nYou can watch my\ntop 4\nmatch below, starting at\n5:05:40\n!\nFinals\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nFinals\nWW\nRyan Loseto\n(\nSableyeVGC\n)\nI felt good for\nfinals\n. I decided not to think too hard, Lilligant + Torkoal and mash buttons it is. Sableye responded with good calls regardless.\nIn Game 1, he covered for nearly every one of my plays. He expected either a Sleep Powder on his Great Tusk, or an After You + Eruption. I went for the third option,\nLeaf Storm\ninto his Great Tusk. This freed up After You + Eruption and allowed me to take the first game swiftly.\nGame 2 Ryan led the same lead, but I know he was not going to make the same mistake. I used\nAfter You + Eruption\n, confident either my Torkoal would live Earthquake or my Lilligant preserve its Focus Sash to sweep. Torkoal did live Earthquake, and I went for a double Protect to scout his Protect the next turn. After failing the double, After You + Eruption chipped Arcanine and took out Great Tusk as my Lilligant fell to Flare Blitz. The final turn was up to a read. Ryan knew I had Power Gem, and Power Gem was the obvious play. I could OHKO both of his Pok\u00e9mon with this move, and I felt like he was deeply pressured to either Icy Wind + Flare Blitz, which was winning for me after Torkoal took out Iron Bundle, or Terastallize into a Water type, which I read with Moonblast. I got the turn correct and won the set\n2-0\n!\nYou can watch the\nfinals\nmatch below, starting at\n6:17:55\n!\nTips for newer players\nBefore finishing, I wanted to give some\ntips\nfor those that will have their first tournament experience soon!\nEAT\n. You will get anxious and live off adrenaline for a long time. Eat as much as you can. If you get time between rounds and you\u2019re hungry, grab a snack. Eat well during lunch break, and eat a good breakfast. You will literally forget to eat, trust me. On Day 2, I was too excited to eat breakfast, forgot to grab a snack on the way to the venue, and fueled myself off adrenaline between rounds. I was STARVING in top cut and it was definitely an unhealthy way to go about it. Bring as much food as you can and bring money to spend on food, you will not regret it.\nDRINK\n. Bring a water bottle and fill up between rounds. You will get a migraine spending 9 rounds staring at a tiny screen without water. Water will put your mind at ease and settle your head. Water doesn\u2019t have the crash sodas do, and you literally cannot afford a crash when you\u2019re playing 12 hours of Pok\u00e9mon. Dehydration and headaches will kill your run.\nSLEEP\n. To complete the trifecta, I want you to repeat after me: playing 3 more ladder games isn\u2019t gonna do you nearly as good as an hour of sleep will. I want you to take the perfect amount of sleep you need, and go to bed an hour earlier. You will not be able to fall asleep thinking about Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn general, a good tip I can give is to relax the day before. Hang out with friends, eat some good food and hit the sack early. You will burn yourself out stressing about Pok\u00e9mon the night before. Get some warm-up if you haven\u2019t, but don\u2019t overplay the game. You are about to play 12 hours of Pok\u00e9mon into another 8 hours, you can afford to relax the day before. Obviously this information depends on who you are as a player, some people need that day to lock in and play 18 hours of Pok\u00e9mon, and if it works it works. All I\u2019m saying is, for most people, you need that day to rest your mind.\nAnd finally, regarding the competitive aspect of the weekend:\nBE RESPECTFUL\n. This isn\u2019t just the obvious stuff, everyone knows not to be plain rude, but try your best to avoid things like groaning and complaining. Things happen, you need to be able to vent out that frustration to people who should be hearing that. Everyone has a support group, but your opponent didn\u2019t sign up to be on it. Take into account other things such as being careful with your opponent\u2019s possessions: be careful with their team sheet, ask before you touch their plushes and make sure your hands are clean before you shake hands and exchange things. Don\u2019t pop off in front of them if you can help it, and definitely don\u2019t make comments suggesting that you got unlucky or that they got lucky. We all signed up to play this game and these things happen.\nTREAT EVERY OPPONENT EQUALLY\n. This is also related about how to play stronger players, the biggest thing I can tell you is to treat them like regular players. Follow your flow charts, play your best, and forget who\u2019s in front of you. Exude confidence, the biggest tip I can give is to save your comments until after the game, even if they\u2019re positive. Say \u201cgood luck\u201d, play out your match, and then let them know you watch their content or are a fan of their play. If you must let them know before the game, please don\u2019t tell them backhanded compliments along the lines of \u201cmy run was going so well\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m gonna lose\u201d. Firstly it gets awkward, there isn\u2019t a response to this comment that feels natural, and secondly you make them feel bad for losing. These players are humans at the end of the day, there are better ways to let them know you look up to them.\nI MADE DAY 2\u2026 NOW WHAT?\nNow you\u2019ve made Day 2, what\u2019s next? Teams will be published shortly. Get a bite to eat and relax for a bit before making your way to bed. Checking out the Day 2 teams, especially players at your record, is a smart decision, but don\u2019t let it interfere with sleep. Discuss harder matchups with friends or pass them off to them while you take your needed 8 hours. Wake up early, check your matchups again, and have a great day at the venue!\nClosing words\nThat\u2019s my story on how\nI won\nVancouver\n! I\u2019m so happy I had such an amazing experience at my first regional. I\u2019m so happy I got to meet such amazing people and have such a good time.\nI want to give a\nshoutout\nto everyone who supported me.

Huge shoutouts to\nAlexis Esparza\n(\nbat\n) and\nShinobi\nfor allowing me to spam your DMs with random information about my team, thank you for always listening.\nThank you to\nAntonio S\u00e1nchez\n(\nRahxen\n) and\nEnosh Shachar\n(\nHuman\n) for being so supportive and discussing matchups with me.\nShoutout to\nCalvin Foster\n(\ncalvonix\n) for being my introduction to Sun and helping me with matchups and just being someone I could ask questions to.\nFinally, a giant shoutout to\nNick Navarre\n(\nNails\n). He\u2019s the creator of the team, but was also someone who was so kind and supportive throughout my run. I didn\u2019t know Nails at all before Vancouver, but he reached out first and listened to all the questions I had, creating a support group where he helped with my entire playoffs gameplans. I\u2019m so glad I got to know him.\nThank you so much to\neveryone\n!\nYou might also like...\nStream details and caster lineup for Bologna Special Event have been announced!\nThe last event of the season in Europe is streamed on 1\u20132 June, with Charlie Merriman, Jamie Boyt, Lee Provost and Markus Stadter as casters.\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez\n28 May, 2024\nDavid Rodr\u00edguez is the 2024 Mexico City Special Event Champion!\n2024 LAIC semifinalist David Rodr\u00edguez has won his fourth Special Event title!
