I\u2019m a\nfinalist again\n! My name is\n\u00c1lex Soto\nand I have been playing competitive Pok\u00e9mon since\n2013\n. In 2023 I specialized in playing\nhard Trick Room\nstrategy, and in\nBochum\nI played\na version of\nmy Liverpool team\n\u2026 without Paradox Pok\u00e9mon! I introduce you to the team, I hope you like it!\nTable of Contents\nThe Team\nMy\nBochum\nteam includes the same six Pok\u00e9mon from\nLiverpool\n\u2026 but changing moves and Tera Types. I already thought that the\nhard Trick Room\nteam was the best option before starting\nRegulation Set B\n, and even if I lost in the final, it gave me a very good result!\nThe idea of the team is to use Trick Room and try to win before it ends. If the strategy works out, you will be the first to finish the matches in a tournament!\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nIndeedee-F\n@ Psychic Seed\nAbility: Psychic Surge\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD\nRelaxed Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Helping Hand\n\u2013 Follow Me\n\u2013 Trick Room\nIndeedee\u2019s role remains the same\nas in\nRegulation Set A\n. It has the same moves and the same EV spread. Its function is to redirect moves or use Trick Room. In addition, its Ability boosts Armarouge and Hatterene\u2019s Psychic-type moves, and also prevents the opponent from using priority moves. Indeedee is great! Also, with the\nGrass\nTera Type, it prevents Amonguss from putting you to sleep!\nDefensive calcs\n252 Atk\nTera-Ground\nGreat Tusk\nHeadlong Rush\nvs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Indeedee-F: 130-154 (73.4 \u2013 87%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nAtk Kingambit\nKowtow Cleave\nvs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Indeedee-F: 152-182 (85.8 \u2013 102.8%) \u2014 12.5% chance to OHKO\n224 Atk Roaring Moon\nThroat Chop\nvs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Indeedee-F: 134-158 (75.7 \u2013 89.2%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nAtk Brute Bonnet\nCrunch\nvs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Indeedee-F: 138-164 (77.9 \u2013 92.6%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nArmarouge\n@ Twisted Spoon\nAbility: Flash Fire\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 228 HP / 76 Def / 148 SpA / 52 SpD\nQuiet Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 4 Spe\n\u2013 Expanding Force\n\u2013 Armor Cannon\n\u2013 Wide Guard\n\u2013 Trick Room\nArmarouge is still the star of the team! Although in the Regulation Set B it\u2019s not that good, as there are a lot of Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon like Roaring Moon or Brute Bonnet\u2026 Still, it works great\nagainst more classic matchups\nlike Dondozo or Maushold + Annihilape.\nIts goal, in addition to using Trick Room, is to do as much damage as possible with Expanding Force. Wide Guard is for mirrors and for Gholdengo, Tatsugiri, and Snarl spam. The\nDark\nTera Type is for the mirror too, and also for Kingambit and Roaring Moon!\nOffensive calcs\n148+ SpA Twisted Spoon Armarouge\nHelping Hand\nExpanding Force\n(120 BP) vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Flutter Mane\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 136-162 (104.6 \u2013 124.6%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n148+ SpA Twisted Spoon Armarouge\nExpanding Force\n(120 BP) vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Iron Bundle\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 175-207 (133.5 \u2013 158%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n148+ SpA Twisted Spoon Armarouge\nHelping Hand\nExpanding Force\n(120 BP) vs. 0 HP / 252 SpD\nAssault Vest\nIron Hands\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 236-282 (103 \u2013 123.1%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n148+ SpA Twisted Spoon Armarouge\nHelping Hand\nExpanding Force\n(120 BP) vs.\n+2\n116 HP / 0 SpD Dondozo\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 126-148 (52.5 \u2013 61.6%) \u2014 98.4% chance to 2HKO after Leftovers recovery\nDefensive calcs\n252 SpA Flutter Mane\nShadow Ball\nvs. 228 HP / 52 SpD Armarouge: 158-188 (83.5 \u2013 99.4%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 Atk\nTera-Ground\nGreat Tusk\nEarthquake\nvs. 228 HP / 76 Def Armarouge: 156-188 (82.5 \u2013 99.4%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n140\n+\nAtk Dondozo\nWave Crash\nvs. 228 HP / 76 Def Armarouge: 158-188 (83.5 \u2013 99.4%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 SpA Gholdengo\nShadow Ball\nvs. 228 HP / 52 SpD Armarouge: 156-186 (82.5 \u2013 98.4%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nTorkoal\n(M) @ Charcoal\nAbility: Drought\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 252 HP / 12 Def / 244 SpA\nQuiet Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Eruption\n\u2013 Flamethrower\n\u2013 Earth Power\n\u2013 Clear Smog\nTorkoal is the broom of the team. It is dedicated to clearing everything in 4 turns due to its incredible\nEruption\ndamage. Also, it is a very solid option against Dondozo due to its\nClear Smog\nmove. Although you have to be careful with some rival Paradox Pok\u00e9mon like Great Tusk, since we will boost its Attack\u2026 The\nFire\nTera Type aims to increase the damage.\nOffensive calcs\n244+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Flutter Mane in Sun: 146-174 (112.3 \u2013 133.8%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n244+ SpA Charcoal Torkoal\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Iron Bundle in Sun: 210-247 (160.3 \u2013 188.5%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n244+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Tera-Flying Roaring Moon in Sun: 188-222 (103.8 \u2013 122.6%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n244+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Volcarona in Sun: 182-216 (113 \u2013 134.1%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n252 SpA\nChoice Specs\nFlutter Mane\nShadow Ball\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Tera-Fire Torkoal: 139-165 (78.5 \u2013 93.2%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 SpA Iron Bundle\nHydro Pump\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Tera-Fire Torkoal in Sun: 116-140 (65.5 \u2013 79%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 Atk Great Tusk\nHeadlong Rush\nvs. 252 HP / 12 Def Tera-Fire Torkoal: 152-182 (85.8 \u2013 102.8%) \u2014 12.5% chance to OHKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nMystic Water\nTera-Water\nPalafin-Hero\nWave Crash\nvs. 252 HP / 12 Def Tera-Fire Torkoal in Sun: 156-184 (88.1 \u2013 103.9%) \u2014 18.8% chance to OHKO\nHatterene\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Magic Bounce\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 212 HP / 68 Def / 196 SpA / 28 SpD\nQuiet Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Psychic\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Mystical Fire\n\u2013 Trick Room\nHatterene is by far the best Pok\u00e9mon on the team. Its offensive coverage is incredible and works very well in Regulation Set B. It is very difficult for the opponent to defend against\nPsychic-, Fairy- and Fire-type moves\n. Also, its Ability is great since you can\u2019t even be put to sleep or Taunted, and that makes you comfortable playing against Amonguss. The\nFire\nTera Type enables leading it out in front of Gholdengo and enhancing the move Mystical Fire.\nOffensive calcs\n196+ SpA Life Orb Hatterene\nHelping Hand Psychic\nvs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Flutter Mane\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 165-195 (126.9 \u2013 150%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n196+ SpA Life Orb Hatterene\nPsychic\nvs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Iron Bundle\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 211-250 (161 \u2013 190.8%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n196+ SpA Life Orb Hatterene\nPsychic\nvs. 108 HP / 84 SpD\nAssault Vest\nIron Hands\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 234-276 (96.2 \u2013 113.5%) \u2014 75% chance to OHKO\n196+ SpA Life Orb\nTera-Fire\nHatterene\nMystical Fire\nvs. 252 HP / 12 SpD\nAssault Vest\nKingambit\nin Sun\n: 211-250 (101.9 \u2013 120.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n252 SpA Flutter Mane\nShadow Ball\nvs. 212 HP / 28 SpD Hatterene: 134-158 (84.2 \u2013 99.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 Atk\nTera-Ground\nGreat Tusk\nHeadlong Rush\nvs. 212 HP / 68 Def Hatterene: 134-158 (84.2 \u2013 99.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 Atk\nProtosynthesis\nTera-Flying\nRoaring Moon\nAcrobatics\n(110 BP) vs. 212 HP / 68 Def Hatterene: 124-147 (77.9 \u2013 92.4%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nSpA\nCharcoal\nTorkoal\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 212 HP / 28 SpD Hatterene in Sun: 135-159 (84.9 \u2013 100%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\nKingambit\n(M) @ Safety Goggles\nAbility: Defiant\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 252 HP / 196 Atk / 20 Def / 36 SpD\nBrave Nature\nIVs: 0 Spe\n\u2013 Kowtow Cleave\n\u2013 Iron Head\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Swords Dance\nKingambit is physical offensive pressure. In addition to working very well against teams with Arcanine, Roaring Moon, and Amoonguss, it punishes the turns that foes use Protect to stall out the Trick Room by using\nSwords Dance\n. The Safety Googles are considered to \u201cdance\u201d in front of Amonguss and Brute Bonnet.

In the back, bring Kingambit and Torkoal. Kingambit does great against Amonguss, Arcanine and Roaring Moon!\nTeams with no Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon\nLead\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nwith Hatterene and Torkoal in the back. When the opponent isn\u2019t using Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon, Armarouge has a blast using Expanding Force!\nLead\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nwith Hatterene and Torkoal in the back. Torkoal does great on the bench, using Clear Smog then. It is important to switch to Indeedee when it is no longer useful, otherwise it becomes useless for the rest of the game.\nIf your opponent has Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon, better go out with\nIndeedee + Hatterene\n; if they don\u2019t, lead with\nArmarouge\n. Kingambit and Torkoal should be in the back. Great Tusk is a very annoying Pok\u00e9mon to deal with, especially the Focus Sash set. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll have to leave it at 1HP and then we can finish it off with Kingambit\u2019s Sucker Punch!\nTournament run\nThis was my run at\nBochum Regionals\n!\nDay 1 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWin\nDaniel Bleich\n(Daniel)\nR2\nWin\nDaniel Scheid\n(yungdan)\nR3\nWW\nSimone Sanvito\n(\n\u2606Sanvy\n)\nR4\nWin\nHeinz Heckmann\n(\nH1\n)\nR5\nWin\nJuan Borreguero\n(\nMithos\n)\nR6\nWin\nRenaud Dutarque\n(\nOtark\n)\nR7\nWin\nJannik Koch\n(\nJannik\n)\nR8\nWin\nGiuseppe Alario\n(\nIl Mule\n)\nR9\nWin\nGuillermo Castilla\n(\nKastyTP\n)\nYou can watch my\nRound 3 set\nversus Simone here!\nDay 2 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nWin\nDavid Koutesh\n(\nHamstermania\n)\nR11\nLoss\nFaaiz Ashfaq\n(\nF/\\$|$\n)\nR12\nLoss\nAur\u00e9lien Soula\n(Sakura)\nR13\nWin\nJorijn Raijmakers\n(\nJori\n)\nR14\nLoss\nMarkus Stadter\n(\nYoshi\n)\nTop Cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWW\nFaaiz Ashfaq\n(\nF/\\$|$\n)\nTop 4\nWin\nV\u00edctor Jim\u00e9nez\n(\nVictorJColl\n)\nFinals\nLL\nMarkus Stadter\n(\nYoshi\n)\nYou can watch my\nTop 8 match\nversus Faaiz here!\nAnd finally, you can watch my\nFinals match\nversus Markus here!\nConclusion\nI have lost another final, but I am very happy!

I was very happy with what I have already achieved at this game, but as you can see my big accomplishments are all a few years in the past, when I was still studying and had much more time to focus on Pok\u00e9mon. When I started working full-time in 2020 I wasn\u2019t sure if I could continue to perform at the highest level, but\nqualifying for Day 2 of\nWorlds in 2022\nand finishing in the\nTop 32\nmotivated me a lot and I decided that I would keep playing with the goal to win tournaments.\nTo be honest sometimes it can be very hard to know that I cannot reach my best because I can\u2019t put in the time and effort anymore while still having very high expectations and goals. I am still learning how to deal with this in the best way and how to be smart about how I use the time I can put into Pok\u00e9mon and I am really glad that I could still win a tournament as prestigious and big as Bochum Regionals all these years later.\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nFirst of all, I need to stress again that this team was mostly built by\nWolfe Glick\n. I am very glad to have a friend like him and that he shared this team with me!\nAfter using Dondozo in\nLiverpool\n, I knew I didn\u2019t want to use it again for\nRegulation Set B\nand instead started to look at other options first. One idea I had pretty soon after Liverpool was to combine the\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nTrick Room core with a Tailwind mode. I thought Speed-boosting Booster Energy\nRoaring Moon\nwould be a good fit because it also has a good match up in the mirror. I didn\u2019t actually test this idea much, but my friends Wolfe and\nAaron Traylor\nlooked into similar ideas so we chatted about them for a bit. Wolfe liked the concept of\nTrick Room + Tailwind\n, but didn\u2019t like Indeedee + Armarouge too much. Also Roaring Moon left the team quickly, since it required Terastalization in many games to get rid of its weaknesses.\nIron Jugulis\nwas something that Wolfe had talked about earlier, but I didn\u2019t believe it could be strong at first.\nThis changed when I saw him use the first version of the team in early February. The team was:\nThis already consisted of 5 out of the 6 final members!\nBrute Bonnet\nwas strong, but the Trick Room mode was a bit awkward and soon Wolfe looked into alternatives to it. Around one and a half weeks before Bochum, I started to talk to Wolfe more about the team.\nIron Hands\nhad joined over Brute Bonnet and we started to spend quite some time to finalize the game plans, EV spreads, moves and Tera Types of the Pok\u00e9mon. We made some decisions that were crucial in both our runs at Regionals and I\u2019m very happy that we put in the time to push the team further rather than being happy with what we had.\nSince\nKnoxville Regionals\nand\nBochum Regionals\nhappened on the same weekend, we had the rare chance to use the same team while not attending the same tournament.\nThe Team\nFind a paste of the team\nhere\n!\nANOKATA\n(Iron Jugulis) @ Booster Energy\nAbility: Quark Drive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 4 SpA / 132 SpD / 116 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Air Slash\n\u2013 Snarl\n\u2013 Tailwind\nIron Jugulis\nwas a core piece of the team and definitely carried its weight in the tournament. The EV split allows it to outrun unboosted Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle, which was crucial to get a Snarl off before they could attack. The Speed lets us outrun max Speed Choice Scarf Annihilape. It is important to outspeed Great Tusk when at -1 Speed, since it is commonly paired with Booster Energy Iron Bundle. The bulk came in handy many times.\nWhen using Iron Jugulis, you need to be aware that it will not do a ton of damage and you need to be smart where to attack to soften up opponents for Gholdengo and Great Tusk. One advantage that Iron Jugulis has over more frail Tailwind setters like Talonflame is that, with Snarl and the bulk, oftentimes you can\nset up Tailwind a second time\nafter the first one peters out.\nThe moves all seem necessary and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to run another moveset on Iron Jugulis if you want it to set up Tailwind like we did.\nSteel\nTera Type was something we adapted pretty late and was supposed to help against Flutter Mane and Dragonite. It didn\u2019t come up very often in the tournament, but I used it in Game 3 of\nRound 10\nto set up Tailwind for a second time against\nJavier Se\u00f1orena\n.\nDefensive calcs\n252 SpA Flutter Mane\nMoonblast\nvs. 252 HP / 132 SpD Iron Jugulis: 170-204 (84.5 \u2013 101.4%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\n76+ Atk Iron Hands\nWild Charge\nvs. 252 HP / 4 Def Iron Jugulis: 180-212 (89.5 \u2013 105.4%) \u2014 31.3% chance to OHKO\nKAITO KID\n(Gholdengo) @ Choice Specs\nAbility: Good as Gold\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 244 HP / 36 Def / 132 SpA / 4 SpD / 92 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Make It Rain\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Power Gem\n\u2013 Trick\nGholdengo\nis a Pok\u00e9mon I enjoyed using a lot in\nRegulation Set A\nand I was happy to see that it could still be strong in Regulation Set B. At first we were running a faster version to make use of Icy Wind support Iron Bundle can provide. However, we realized that Gholdengo is strongest when it is\nled next to Iron Jugulis\nand that bulk is needed to survive some combination of hits. Snarl from Iron Jugulis helps Gholdengo a lot as it lowers the damage output from Flutter Mane and other fast Pok\u00e9mon that threaten Gholdengo.\nThe Speed outruns Choice Scarf Tatsugiri and speed-creeps other bulky Gholdengo and bulky Annihilape. We chose to run Power Gem to help against Arcanine. I didn\u2019t use Power Gem very often, but most of the time you are using Make It Rain anyway. Trick was there against bulky teams and against Trick Room. How it can completely win games on the spot was showcased well in Game 2 of\nfinals\n. Steel Tera Type is great to get rid of Ghost- and Dark-type weaknesses and to boost Make It Rain even further.\nOffensive calcs\n132+ SpA Choice Specs Gholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Great Tusk: 195-229 (102 \u2013 119.8%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n252+ SpA Flutter Mane\nShadow Ball\nvs. 244 HP / 4 SpD Gholdengo: 168-198 (87 \u2013 102.5%) \u2014 12.5% chance to OHKO\nJUZO MEGURE\n(Great Tusk) @ Life Orb\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGround\nEVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\nIVs: 28 HP\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Headlong Rush\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Earthquake\nLife Orb\nGreat Tusk\nis such a strong Pok\u00e9mon that it can easily tear through teams especially after they were hit by Make It Rain.\nA regular battle with the team would often be to lead Iron Jugulis and Gholdengo, set Tailwind and attack with Make It Rain. Now the opponent has to make a\nchoice\n: if they attack Iron Jugulis, they will probably fail to knock it out easily because it is so bulky and will have to take more Make It Rain. If they knock out Gholdengo, Great Tusk will come in and can pressure with Earthquake thanks to Iron Jugulis\u2019 Flying type and its 120 STAB moves. They only have a few turns to knock out Iron Jugulis or Tailwind will be set up for a second time. And even if they knock out Iron Jugulis, Iron Bundle can come in and provide more speed control for Great Tusk with Icy Wind.\nGround\nTera Type is used to boost Earthquake and Headlong Rush even further. We used\nJolly\nto outspeed all Gholdengo and bulky Arcanine and to get at least the speed tie against opposing Great Tusk. Unfortunately max Speed Booster Energy Iron Bundle always outspeeds Great Tusk in Tailwind, but that is something you have to play around. We chose to run 28 HP IVs because we wanted to run max Attack and max Speed and couldn\u2019t find any defensive calcs that changed with a\n189 HP stat value\nand it seemed likely to get off multiple attacks with Great Tusk. If you can find arguments to run 31 HP IV, please let me know, I\u2019m genuinely curious!\nAI HAIBARA\n(Iron Bundle) @ Focus Sash\nAbility: Quark Drive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFlying\nEVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Icy Wind\n\u2013 Encore\n\u2013 Freeze-Dry\nWe opted to run\nFocus Sash\nsince Booster Energy was already taken and Covert Cloak didn\u2019t come up very often in testing. Instead Focus Sash provided us with a lifeline that Iron Bundle appreciates.\nTera Type is\nFlying\nto help against Great Tusk and more notably to avoid being hit by our own Great Tusk\u2019s Earthquakes. We agreed that we didn\u2019t want to run Hydro Pump and I think we succeeded in finding a moveset that actually gets away with not running it. Encore combos really nicely with Gothitelle\u2019s Shadow Tag and helps a lot in the Dondozo match-up because it prevents them from going for Protect or Substitute, which means that Fake Out from Iron Hands is pretty effective against it. Encore also came in handy to punish opponents for setting up Tailwind, going for Fake Out or Protect and for securing end games.\nMIWAKO SATO\n(Gothitelle) @ Leftovers\nAbility: Shadow Tag\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 252 HP / 124 Def / 132 SpD\nCalm Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 3 Spe\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Charm\n\u2013 Psychic\n\u2013 Trick Room\nGothitelle\nwas amazing on this type of team. It provided the team with a\nTrick Room mode\nthat can be transitioned into quite nicely after the 4 turns of Tailwind are over. With Charm and Leftovers, it can lock in physical attackers like Dragonite and turn the game essentially in a 2v1. Charm is also really helpful versus Dondozo.\nWe decided not to run\nFake Out\n, because Gothitelle functions a bit differently on our team than on other Tailwind teams where it was seen before. Instead of supporting for example Flutter Mane as a lead, Gothitelle usually comes in the back together with Iron Hands to seal up end games. And if we decide to lead Gothitelle, it is usually next to Iron Hands to set up Trick Room early, which doesn\u2019t require Gothitelle to use Fake Out.\nLeftovers vs Sitrus Berry was a debate we had, but looking back at some of our games, we realized that Gothitelle can stay on the field for a pretty long time, making\nLeftovers\nmore effective.\nSteel\nTera Type helps Gothitelle to wall Dragonite, which was otherwise a problem for the team. Gothitelle hits a\nSpeed stat value of\u00a071\n, which is 1 below min Speed Armarouge, while still outspeeding e.g. Adamant Great Tusk in Tailwind.\nDefensive calcs\n252\n+\nSpA\nLife Orb\nFlutter Mane\nShadow Ball\nvs. 252 HP / 132+ SpD Gothitelle: 151-179 (85.3 \u2013 101.1%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\nGENTA KOJIMA\n(Iron Hands) @ Assault Vest\nAbility: Quark Drive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 100 HP / 156 Atk / 252 SpD\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Fake Out\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Wild Charge\n\u2013 Drain Punch\nIron Hands\nwas the last Pok\u00e9mon to join the team and felt like the correct Pok\u00e9mon to complete the Trick Room mode we wanted to include. With\nAssault Vest\nand max Special Defense, it becomes really bulky also on the Special side and can even take on Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle. We decided to use\nGrass\nTera Type mostly against Amoonguss and Great Tusk.\nInitially, the Iron Hands we used was pretty fast to abuse Tailwind more, but we realized that we needed to be slower than Armarouge to outspeed it in Trick Room. Since we wanted Iron Hands to hit before Gothitelle in Trick Room, we put it at a\nSpeed stat value of\n70\nto still outspeed Adamant Great Tusk in Tailwind. This is relevant against Dondozo, to be able to break the Substitute first with Wild Charge, before lowering its Attack with Gothitelle\u2019s Charm. While I used 70 Speed stat on Iron Hands, Wolfe didn\u2019t want to speed-tie Kingambit with no Speed investment and ran 69 Speed stat. I had already shiny-hunted for one and didn\u2019t want to get one with 29 Speed IVs, so I stuck with 31.\nClose Combat\nwas the first fighting move we used and we liked the damage output it provided, but\nDrain Punch\nfelt strong when Trick Room was set up to knock out Kingambit or Tyranitar, when dropping its Defenses wasn\u2019t necessary. Running both felt like the right choice to me and I ended up using Drain Punch more often than Close Combat in the tournament.\nHow to use the team\nOpponent\u2019s team\nComments\nGeneral\nOption 1: Lead\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\n, with Iron Bundle and Great Tusk in the back.\nOption 2: Lead\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\n, with Gothitelle and Iron Hands in the back.\nThese are the standard picks for the team. Use Iron Jugulis to support with Tailwind and Snarl and Gholdengo to soften up the opposition. Then, transition into Great Tusk + Iron Bundle or into Gothitelle + Iron Hands to finish the game.\nFast teams that cannot stop Trick Room\nLead\nGothitelle + Iron Hands\n, with Gholdengo and Iron Jugulis in the back.\nOne of the beauties of the open team sheet format is that you can look precisely for counterplay to certain leads. If the opponent was running a Tailwind team that could not stop turn 1 Fake Out + Trick Room, it\u2019s often a great choice.\nGavin Michaels\n\u2018s\nOCIC\nteam\nLead\nGothitelle + Iron Hands\n, with Gholdengo and Iron Bundle in the back.\nGothitelle is great against Palafin, and Iron Hands supports it to get Trick Room up when it is needed. Charm helps a lot against Dragonite and even Baxcalibur and the team doesn\u2019t have much to hit Gholdengo.\nDondozo teams\nOption 1: Lead\nIron Bundle + Gholdengo\n, with Iron Hands and Gothitelle in the back.\nUse Iron Bundle + Gholdengo early to put pressure on the opponent and to force Dondozo in. Then use Iron Hands + Gothitelle to set up Trick Room and Charm the Dondozo.\nOption 2: Lead\nGothitelle + Iron Hands\n, with Iron Bundle and Great Tusk in the back.\nIt can also be a good strategy to lead Gothitelle and to set up Trick Room early. Iron Bundle + Great Tusk can usually manage to power through a boosted Dondozo.\nTrick Room teams\nLead\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\n, with Iron Hands and Gothitelle in the back.\nIron Jugulis + Gothitelle is really strong here as you can lower their damage output with Snarl while trapping them in, and also reverse the Trick Room when necessary with Gothitelle.\nOther options\nLead\nIron Jugulis + Great Tusk\n.\nIron Jugulis + Gothitelle is really strong here as you can lower their damage output with Snarl while trapping them in, and also reverse the Trick Room when necessary with Gothitelle.\nMajor threats\nThreat\nComments\nDragonite completely walls Great Tusk and only Iron Bundle can hit it for super effective damage.\nCounterplay\n: Use\nGholdengo\nand Steel-Tera Type\nGothitelle\n\u2018s Charm.\nKingambit completely walls Iron Jugulis + Gholdengo and makes Snarl very risky.\nCounterplay\n: Use\nGreat Tusk\nand\nIron Hands\nto force it to Terastallize and go from there.\nThis was not something we considered in team building.

In Games 2 and 3 he led Flutter Mane against my Iron Jugulis + Gholdengo lead and we had to play an awkward\nmindgame\nif he would set up Trick Room to counter my Tailwind or attack into Iron Jugulis or into Gholdengo. The set was pretty close, but in the end I barely won.\nR2\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR2\nWW\nKusha K.\n(Busha)\nJust before the games I went through some game plans vs\nGavin Michaels\n\u2019s\nOCIC\nwinning team\njust to face that exact team a few minutes later.

I was able to get out of that position and forced Baxcalibur to go for Electric-Tera Type Terastallization (\n!\n) later on against my Gholdengo. I thought I was winning Game 1, but in the end I barely lost. For Game 2 I decided to go with\nGothitelle + Iron Hands\nlead with Iron Jugulis and Great Tusk in the back. However, my opponent led with\nVolcarona + Flutter Mane\nand it was almost over right away. I got Trick Room up, but then my Iron Hands got burned by Heat Wave (ironically after avoiding being burnt by Flame Body twice before) and there wasn\u2019t much I could do after that.\nI told myself that\n3-1\nafter 4 rounds isn\u2019t too bad and focused on the next round.\nR5\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR5\nWW\nFrancesco Raga\n(\nLil Darkrai\n)\nGame 1 I put on a lot of pressure with\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\nlead against their\nTauros + Flutter Mane\nlead and I won pretty convincingly.

I set up Trick Room and predicted their Protects correctly for a satisfying victory.\nIt made me pretty happy that I won against a strong player after the loss the round before, and I felt good about my chances of top cutting at this point.\nR6\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR6\nLWL\nSimon Bernard\n(Ryo)\nA pretty standard Talonflame + Great Tusk team. Game 1 I brought\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\nlead with Iron Hands and Gothitelle in the back. The plan was to use Snarl early on to limit the Flutter Mane\u2019s damage output and to then transition into Trick Room to clean the game with Iron Hands. I think I got in a pretty decent position midway, but I didn\u2019t play super well once Trick Room got up and lost against their Tyranitar and Great Tusk in the back with my Iron Hands and Gothitelle when we were both out of Terastallization. Game 2 I decided to try and get a cheese win and led with\nIron Jugulis + Iron Bundle\nagainst their\nTalonflame + Tyranitar\n. I switched Iron Jugulis into Gothitelle right away and Encored their Talonflame. Talonflame went for Tailwind and was now trapped and locked in. I proceeded to set up Trick Room and got into a nice position with Iron Hands. Game 3 I decided to abandon my Trick Room mode and went with\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\nwith Iron Bundle and Great Tusk in the back instead. I don\u2019t remember exactly how, but I think I lost Iron Jugulis too quickly and couldn\u2019t keep speed control going. Steel-Tera Type Flutter Mane was a problem this game as well.\nThis meant I was\n4-2\nand had to win the remaining 3 in order to advance to Day 2. I didn\u2019t feel too good after this loss, but at the same time I thought that my opponents would be in the same boat from now on \u2013 facing elimination \u2013 and that I could deal with this situation better than them.\nR7\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR7\nWW\nChristian Bicker\n(Chrisbe)\nI tried to\nplay safe\nin Game 1, but in hindsight I felt like maybe I played a bit too safe.

Well, screw that, I got an\nup-pair\nand it was against Enosh! I wasn\u2019t too happy to face him at this point, but I knew I needed to beat anyone to deserve Day 2. At least I had the rare chance to play against a friend at X-2 and not to knock them out in case I win.\nI had heard he played on stream before and that he had a bulky Glimmora. I didn\u2019t actually get to see too much of that as I KO\u2019d it with Make It Rain and Great Tusk\u2019s Ground-type attacks pretty quickly in all 3 games. Game 1 I led\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\nvs his\nTorkoal + Dragonite\nand went for the double up on the Torkoal, which went for Grass-Tera Type Terastallization. Air Slash + Shadow Ball picked up the KO and I was in a pretty good position from there. In Game 2 he attacked himself to set Toxic Spikes which would then make my Iron Bundle\u2019s Focus Sash useless and allowed Palafin and Dragonite to beat Iron Bundle. To prevent that from happening, I led\nIron Bundle + Gholdengo\nin Game 3 and got into a strong offensive position. Eventually it came down to whether his Dragonite and Palafin could take me out with their priority moves, but Great Tusk survived the Jet Punch and allowed me to win.\nR9\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR9\nWLW\nMatt Maynard\n(\nbwenty\n)\nGoing into this match, I knew that it would be very important to pick the correct Pok\u00e9mon for each game. I knew I wanted Iron Jugulis versus the Great Tusk. And if I can get the speed advantage, Great Tusk and Gholdengo can do pretty well against Gholdengo / Annihilape + Maushold.\nGame 1 I went for my standard fast mode with\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\nlead with Great Tusk + Iron Bundle in the back. My opponent led\nAnnihilape + Roaring Moon\nwith Talonflame and Gholdengo in the back. My Gholdengo was in a good position to go for Make It Rain and, when it went down, I could bring in Great Tusk for great effect. Talonflame in the back surprised me a bit, but I managed to win Game 1.\nFor Game 2 I expected a Maushold + Annihilape lead as, with Fire-Tera Type Annihilape, he would be in a solid position against my Iron Jugulis + Gholdengo lead from Game 1. Therefore I decided to go with\nIron Jugulis + Great Tusk\n. However, Matt went for a different switch-up, leading\nTalonflame + Great Tusk\n. Soon I knew we would be going to a Game 3.\nSince Talonflame + Great Tusk was doing good work for my opponent in Game 1, I wanted to make sure that I could beat that with my Game 3 lead and decided to go with\nIron Jugulis + Iron Bundle\n. However my opponent switched it up again and went with\nMaushold + Gholdengo\n! I brought in Great Tusk early on and went for a big Ground Tera Type-boosted Earthquake, which got rid of the Maushold, however it failed to knock out Gholdengo, which activated its Weakness Policy and set up a Nasty Plot as well! This meant that I was facing a +4 Gholdengo which then got supported by Speed-boosting Booster Energy Roaring Moon the next turn. I felt like it was already over here, but forced myself to come up with a way to still win this game. I wasn\u2019t sure if my opponent would be aware that +1 Speed Iron Jugulis outspeeds their Roaring Moon and would get to move first and KO Gholdengo, should it not protect. Going for their misplay seemed to be my best option so I went for Snarl instead of Air Slash \u2013 hoping for a misplay rather than trying to go for the flinch. My opponent decided to Protect and Tailwind, but used their Terastallization and my Snarl + Close Combat got the KO on Roaring Moon. Now Gholdengo started to get some KOs with its increased Special Attack; however, with some Protects, I could stall out their Tailwind, which allowed my full-HP Iron Bundle to stall out the last turn of Tailwind with Protect to be up against the low-HP Gholdengo + full-HP Great Tusk. I needed Icy Wind to connect with both and to knock out the Gholdengo. Fortunately, I hit and it was enough for the Gholdengo, which meant that Iron Bundle could get the final knock out on Great Tusk and\nI would move on to Day 2\n!\nIt was a lot closer than I would have liked it, and I felt just very happy to make it there at all.\n7-2\nmeant that I would need to go at least 4-1 on Day 2, but at this point I told myself that Top 16 would already be a good result and that I would just take it from game to game. This allowed myself to relax during the evening, which was nice.\nDay 2 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nLWW\nJavier Se\u00f1orena\n(\nJavi\n)\nR11\nWLW\nSimon Schl\u00fctter\n(Simon)\nR12\nWLW\nGuillermo Castilla\n(\nKastyTP\n)\nR13\nLWW\nFaaiz Ashfaq\n(\nF/\\$|$\n)\nR14\nWW\n\u00c1lex Soto\n(\nLenVGC\n)\nNotes\nR10\nR11\nR12\nR13\nR14\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR10\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nLWW\nJavier Se\u00f1orena\n(\nJavi\n)\nThis match was played on stream. Javier used a pretty standard bulky team and I was happy to see that\nhe wasn\u2019t running Arcanine\n, which can be problematic for me. You can watch the match\nbelow\nand hear my thoughts in the interview afterwards.\nR11\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR11\nWLW\nSimon Schl\u00fctter\n(Simon)\nMy first Dondozo of the tournament! In all 3 games I went with an\nIron Bundle + Gholdengo\nlead with Gothitelle and Iron Hands in the back.\nIn Game 1 my opponent didn\u2019t bring Dondozo and led with\nTalonflame + Great Tusk\n. This wasn\u2019t amazing for me, but I managed to set up Trick Room and barely won. I think this approach by my opponent was correct for the match-up and I hoped to see an adaptation to Dondozo in Game 2.\nHe actually did go with a\nDondozo\nlead in Game 2 and fused right away to knock out my Gholdengo. However, this was totally fine as his Dondozo\u2019s Tera Type was Dragon, which meant that Iron Bundle could spam Freeze-Dry to knock it out. Since we had Encore on it, Dondozo cannot protect against Fake Out and this should be a good position for me\u2026 theoretically. For some reason I switched in Gothitelle instead of Iron Hands. I immediately realized what I just did and tried to bring the game back somehow. I think I got close, but in the end this\nmistake\ncost me. I wasn\u2019t sure if my opponent also realized my mistake and just hoped to see the same plan from him in Game 3.\nLuckily, they decided to do the\nexact same thing\nagain and knocked out Gholdengo on Turn 1. This meant I could bring in Iron Hands and, with the recoil from Wave Crash, Freeze-Dry and Fake Out, I planned to get the Dondozo at low health so I could knock it out and KO the Tatsugiri on the same turn with Close Combat. However, my Freeze-Dry crit, which meant this wasn\u2019t an option anymore. Simon then tried to gain momentum by Terastallizing Tatsugiri into Steel, but I eventually could set up Trick Room and sweep.\nI can\u2019t tell why I switched in the wrong Pok\u00e9mon, but it bothered me quite a bit after the set. Luckily, I got away with such a mistake and started off Day 2 with\n2-0\n.\nR12\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR12\nWLW\nGuillermo Castilla\n(\nKastyTP\n)\nIn Round 12 I was paired against Kasty. I was looking forward to this game, because even though both Kasty and I have played for over a decade, we have very rarely played against each other and I think\nthis was the first time ever\nin an official offline tournament. Team preview reminded me a bit of the other Spanish player I played already that day, but, unlike Javier, Kasty was running\nArcanine\n. Regardless, I decided to go with\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\nas my lead with Iron Bundle and Great Tusk in the back, just like I did against Javier.\nIn the first game, Kasty brought\nGholdengo\n, which he Terastallized into Water;\nIron Bundle\n; Iron Hands, and Roaring Moon. The game was very long and positional, but eventually I got into a good position and won.\nIn Game 2, he adapted by leading\nIron Hands\nto stop my Gholdengo from doing so much damage immediately and by bringing Arcanine in the back. I doubled the Iron Hands on turn 1 as it Terastalized into Grass, but that meant Air Slash dealt a lot of damage. I knocked out Iron Hands very early and seemed to be in a fantastic position, however Kasty capitalized on my passive play in the following turns. In the end, it was my Ground-Tera Type Great Tusk at 50% vs his -1 Speed Iron Bundle that was hit by Icy Wind and his Arcanine at 50%. If Earthquake KOd the Iron Bundle, I had a guaranteed win, but I wasn\u2019t sure if the roll would be in my favor. Instead I decided to Close Combat the Iron Bundle predicting it not to protect. I thought that if I got that right, worst case he would go for Will-O-Wisp and I could still KO the Arcanine despite the burn. Iron Bundle didn\u2019t protect and I felt good about my chances of winning as Close Combat got the KO. His Arcanine, which I knew was quite bulky, went for Flare Blitz and it was enough to knock out my Great Tusk after the Life Orb chip and with the -1 Defense from using Close Combat. I think\nwe both weren\u2019t quite sure if it would KO\n, but that meant that the series would go into a Game 3.\nThis time I decided to lead\nIron Jugulis + Great Tusk\nto pressure the Iron Hands and Arcanine early on, so that I could sweep with Gholdengo later. He Terastallized his Roaring Moon into Flying early and I don\u2019t remember exactly how it went, but at some point I was able to get the speed advantage, which allowed me to spam Icy Wind with my Iron Bundle. Eventually my Gholdengo could then knock out the slowed-down Pok\u00e9mon of my opponent.\nAfter this round, I felt like I had a real chance of making Top 8. However, when running the math and looking at the results so far, it looked like it would be tough for me to make it in with 11-3, which meant\nI would likely have to win both my next games\n. Between the games I had been talking to\nFaaiz Ashfaq\n, who was also at a 10-2 record after this round, and I knew there was a chance we had to face soon.\nR13\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR13\nLWW\nFaaiz Ashfaq\n(\nF/\\$|$\n)\nIt\u2019s\nnever easy to play a friend\n, but similarly to my Round 8 against Enosh, it seemed that I had to win to stay in contention for Top Cut, while Faaiz\u2019s tie-breaker was good enough that he would probably make it in at 11-3. Regardless of that, we both told each other that we would give our best and would be happy regardless of the result. We both knew about each other\u2019s teams but we hadn\u2019t played the match-up before, so I was curious to see how it would play out.\nIn Game 1 I expected a Maushold + Flutter Mane lead and decided to go for\nIron Jugulis + Great Tusk\n. I was pretty happy when he sent out\nMaushold + Flutter Mane\n, but it wasn\u2019t over yet. I decided to go for Tailwind and Ground Tera Type-boosted Earthquake, but both of his Pok\u00e9mon survived and he got a crit with Dazzling Gleam, which knocked out both of my Pok\u00e9mon right away! I sent out Iron Hands and Iron Bundle, but I couldn\u2019t break through the Torkoal he had in the back. Faaiz was pretty sorry for the crit, but I felt like I could still bring it back.\nIn Game 2, he opted for a\nTorkoal + Flutter Mane\nlead, but decided to switch out Torkoal for Maushold on Turn 1. I ran with the\nsame lead\nand this time turn 1 was more favorable for me as I got a big Earthquake off. This time, I brought Gholdengo over Iron Hands and it paid off as I won the game.\nIn Game 3 we were back to\nour leads of Game 1\n. His Flutter Mane survived the combination of Snarl + Ground Tera Type-boosted Earthquake with exactly\n1 HP\n, which got me worried, but eventually I converted what felt like a pretty good match-up and I would move on to\n11-2\n.\nR14\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR14\nWW\n\u00c1lex Soto\n(\nLenVGC\n)\nCheck out \u00c1lex\u2019s team report\nhere\n!\nI had heard that \u00c1lex Soto was running the\nsame 6 as\nhe used\nin\nLiverpool\nand that he was cruising through the competition. With how the tie-breakers were before the round, it was pretty clear that he was guaranteed Top 8 even if he lost, while I had to win to make it through. I hadn\u2019t practiced the hard Trick Room match-up much, but I knew that Iron Jugulis + Gothitelle gave me the team advantage. Wolfe had made some plans against this team and I was looking forward to trying them out against arguably the\nbest hard Trick Room user in\nScarlet\n&\nViolet\nso far.\nThe plan for Game 1 was pretty simple: lead\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\n, threaten Snarl to bait in Kingambit but to\nTrick the Indeedee on turn 1 and switch in Gothitelle to trap it in\n. This might sound familiar to those who have watched the finals. He led with\nArmarouge + Indeedee\nand I decided to stick with the plan. It worked perfectly as he switched Armarouge into Kingambit and went for Trick Room. Now Indeedee was pretty much useless as it was forced to set and reverse Trick Room for eternity (well, at least until the PP ran out) while I could safely protect and switch to Iron Hands as \u00c1lex set up a Swords Dance. Now I expected my Iron Hands to be faster and went for Close Combat to guarantee the knock out on Kingambit. From there, I could continue to play it safe to win Game 1.\nFor Game 2, the plan was to use Snarl from\nIron Jugulis + Gothitelle\nto play around potential counterplay against the Trick + Shadow Tag lock I used in Game 1. Again \u00c1lex led\nIndeedee + Armarouge\n. This time he used Wide Guard to block the Snarl and Dazzling Gleam to play around a potential counter Trick Room, but he was still stuck with Armarouge and Indeedee against my Iron Jugulis + Gothitelle. I knew that Helping Hand + Life Orb-boosted Armor Cannon wouldn\u2019t knock out my Iron Jugulis, so I kept going for Snarl and some chip damage with Psychic. Eventually he got Trick Room up, but Psychic Terrain ran out soon and I made sure that I got into a position where I could bring in Great Tusk outside of Trick Room. Knowing neither of his Pok\u00e9mon had Protect, this meant that I had a lot of pressure and I decided to play risky by going for Earthquake. He Terastallized Armarouge and tried to attack instead of going for Wide Guard, but my Life Orb- & Ground Tera Type-boosted Earthquake got the KO on Armarouge, and from there the game was over.\n\u00c1lex was very friendly after our games and it felt good knowing that both of us reached the Top 8. I had done it! Going 8-0 after 4-2 with a\n5-0 on Day 2\nto make it into Top 8. To my delight, Faaiz won his last round and was also in! We celebrated a bit and had some overpriced slices of pizza while the Top 8 standings went up.\nTop Cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWLW\nMichael Kelsch\n(\nMichi\n)\nTop 4\nWLW\nAur\u00e9lien Soula\n(Sakura)\nFinals\nWW\n\u00c1lex Soto\n(\nLenVGC\n)\nNotes\nTop 8\nTop 4\nFinals\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nTop 8\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWLW\nMichael Kelsch\n(\nMichi\n)\nMy opponent in Top 8 was none other than Michael, also known as\nMichaelderBeste\n. He rose to fame in the German community before this event by coming out of seemingly nowhere and\ndominating the Limitless tour scene\n. I mean, just look at this!\nIt seemed very fitting that, in order to win the event, I would have to beat the best players from Germany first. After beating Faaiz in Round 13, I felt good going up against Michael now. We had talked a bit during Day 2 as soon as I learned who he was and many others came up to him to congratulate him on a great run in\nhis very first offline tournament\n(!). It was already a great accomplishment to make it that far, and knowing about his online success, it was clearly not a fluke. It also meant that he played a lot of games with his team against high-level competition.\nFor all three games, I went with\nIron Jugulis + Gholdengo\nwith Gothitelle and Iron Hands in the back. The nature of this match-up is that I need to get into a position to set up Trick Room. His Covert Cloak Talonflame with Taunt made it impossible to just lead Gothitelle right away. He alternated leads throughout the set and I think he didn\u2019t find the right pick against Iron Jugilis + Gholdengo. Here it came in very clutch that I was using something he probably didn\u2019t face too often, while I was playing a match-up that I had a lot of experience with.\nIn Game 1 Gholdengo did a lot of work against his\nDragonite + Flutter Mane\nlead and I could set up Trick Room to clear with Iron Hands and Gothitelle.\nIn Game 2 he led with\nGreat Tusk + Dragonite\n, which meant that he could get rid of Gholdengo on turn 1 but not before I did a lot of damage with Make It Rain, bringing Great Tusk down to its Focus Sash. I went down to my last two Pok\u00e9mon quickly but then managed to set up Trick Room and got into the position I wanted. It was Iron Hands and Gothitelle against Flutter Mane and Iron Bundle and he hadn\u2019t Terastillized yet. I was debating whether to Drain Punch the Flutter Mane, but decided that was too risky as I couldn\u2019t confirm his spread in Game 1. He did go for the Steel-Tera Type Terastallization and my combination of Wild Charge + Psychic barely missed the knockout, resulting in a big attack from his side which sealed the game.\nI was most afraid of a Flutter Mane + Talonflame lead, but instead he went with\nGreat Tusk + Flutter Mane\n. Once again this meant that Gholdengo could get off some big damage before going down. Again I managed to set up Trick Room, and this time he had to commit Terastallization early and couldn\u2019t stop my Gothitelle and Iron Hands from sweeping the game. I congratulated him on an amazing run into Top 8 at his first event and I really think that his performance was very impressive considering this is his first year of VGC.\nI realized that\nI would finally get my first medal\nfrom a Regional and was really happy about that. Faaiz had lost, so it meant that I would be the last remaining German in Top 4.\nTop 4\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 4\nWLW\nAur\u00e9lien Soula\n(Sakura)\nTop 4 would be against Aur\u00e9lien, also known as\nAxior\n, who is part of the\nNPA\nteam I\u2019m co-managing for the second year, so I was following their journey as a Senior last year closely and I\u2019m very happy that they could\ntranslate their success into Masters\nin his first season. I knew they were using the\nteam\nfrom\nKyle Livinghouse\n(\nAnimus\n) and\nRob McNeilly\n(\nDeishu\n) that they already used at\nOCIC\n. I ran some practice games agaist this a few days before the tournament and thought that this would be a tough match-up. Volcarona + Maushold is not so easy to break for me, Dragonite and Gholdengo are also pretty annoying.\nYou can watch the games\nbelow\n. I changed my pick for each game to be prepared for a potential adaptation from Axior, and since I felt like I couldn\u2019t handle all different modes their team had with one pick. When I got the prediction on Great Tusk attacking under Trick Room right in Game 3, I knew that I was going to\nadvance to the finals\n! You can hear some more thoughts I had about these games in my interview afterwards.\nFinals\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nFinals\nWW\n\u00c1lex Soto\n(\nLenVGC\n)\nCheck out \u00c1lex\u2019s team report\nhere\n!\nFinals would be a rematch of my Round 14 of Swiss\u2014my only set of the day so far that I won in 2 games\u2014all other sets went into Game 3. Naturally, I was pretty glad to hear that I would be rematching \u00c1lex. This would be\nhis 3rd Regionals finals and my 4th\n. Thinking about the outcomes of these finals, I knew that \u00c1lex didn\u2019t have that big offline tournament win yet and would give everything to win. But now wasn\u2019t the time for sympathy, and likewise I wanted to give my best to convert what I thought was a pretty good match-up and win my 3rd Regionals. You can watch the finals\nbelow\n. Since we already played in Swiss,\nhe knew about my Trick + Shadow Tag plan\nand that Iron Jugulis + Gothitelle would provide serious trouble for his team.\nIn Game 1 I decided to Snarl and switch into Gothitelle since I punished his Kingambit switch-in in Swiss and didn\u2019t want to take a KO to potentially let Torkoal in under Trick Room. This plan worked pretty well and I was able to slow down the game with Iron Jugulis and Gothitelle and clean with Gholdengo and Iron Hands. I went for Terastallization on Grass-Tera Type Iron Hands to make sure I wouldn\u2019t go down to a crit from Hatterene\u2014not sure if that was really necessary.\nBeing up 1-0 I decided to go for the Trick play in Game 2 and it worked perfectly. It meant that I would be under control the entire game and I made sure not to let go of my lead. \u00c1lex tried what he could (including the triple Trick Room turn), but in the end it was too difficult to come back from the turn 1 play. \u00c1lex took it very well in the moment and\nI am sure he will win a Regional soon\n.\nAnd with this I had done it!\nI became a Regional Champion again\nin the venue where I won my first big offline tournament, German Nationals in 2014. We had a short ceremony and interview on stage and I got really emotional with\nmy friends cheering for me\nand me claiming the title in a venue that meant a lot to me.\nClosing words\nI mentioned it before and I have to say it again: I could not have won this tournament if it wasn\u2019t for\nWolfe Glick\n\u2019s incredible teambuilding. He saw something in\nIron Jugulis\nthat no one else saw,\njust like he did\nwith\nScream Tail\nearlier in the format\n. Thank you for letting me join the teambuilding process and helping me prepare for the event!\nAnother big shoutout goes to\nYuki Zaninovich\nwho supported me from home during the tournament and helped me to stay calm when I knew I had to win every game to advance.\nThank you to\nFaaiz Ashfaq\n,\nBaris Akcos\nand\nFevzi \u00d6zkan\nwho supported me in\nBochum\nin person, it was amazing to share this experience with you!\nAnd last but not least to\nall my other friends\n,\nmy girlfriend\nand\nmy family\nwho supported me on this weekend and always.
