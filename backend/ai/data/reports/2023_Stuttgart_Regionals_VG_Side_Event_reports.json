I\u2019m\nConstantin Klose\n(you can call me\nConni\nor\nNnico\n) and I\u2019ve been playing VGC since\nSword\nand\nShield\n, but had never actually competed in any tournament.\nI was determined to\ngo all in on VGC\nwhen the new games came out, so I could be on a somewhat equal playing field with experienced players and I was excited to take part in exploring the new metagame.\nI didn\u2019t know how good my teambuilding skills were compared to the pros and so I went in with my only expectation being to\nhave fun\nand to try to get a win or two.\nI knew however that\nPalafin\ncould work against a plethora of different team styles, whether that be Tailwind offense, Trick Room or most setup strategies, thanks to Jet Punch being easily exploitable with Palafin\u2019s enormous Attack stat and the possibility to further increase its damage output with Rain.\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nWhen I played through the game, there were two new pokemon that caught my eye:\nKilowattrel\nand\nPalafin\n.\nI immediately thought I could incorporate them into\na Rain team\nand, after calculating the power of a Jet Punch powered up by STAB, Terastallizing, a Choice Band and Rain, I was sure this was going to be a force to be reckoned with.\nI also had a\nDiscquake\n(Discharge + Earthquake) combo in mind with Kilowattrel and\nKrookodile\n, since I wanted an Intimidate user that I could switch in for Palafin, but Krookodile never saw use and I quickly dropped it from the team.\nSince everyone was originally playing with the Treasures of Ruin and Paradox Pok\u00e9mon, I also used\nFlutter Mane\nand\nChien-Pao\n. The former could deal with Iron Bundle and chip everything into Jet Punch range, while the latter provided lots of important tools in Ice Spinner to remove Psychic Terrain, a Dark-type move to threaten Farigiraf and of course Sword of Ruin to maximize Palafin\u2019s damage output.\nLastly,\nPelipper\nwas the obvious choice as my Rain setter and could come in handy with Wide Guard, while\nAmoonguss\ntied it all together and gave me a switchout option that resists Palafin\u2019s weaknesses as well as a better Trick Room matchup.\nSo that was the first version of the team, which I probably would have used if Series 1 included Paradox Pok\u00e9mon and the Treasures of Ruin!\nThe\nfirst tournament in\nStuttgart\nwas announced and I was hyped to find out how well I could do with Palafin, which I imagined was considered a bit of a niche pick that most people wouldn\u2019t prepare for too much. Then we got to know we\u2019d have to play without Paradox Pok\u00e9mon and Treasures of Ruin. I knew I still wanted to go for the same strategy since Palafin was still available, but I wasn\u2019t sure I knew the best Pok\u00e9mon to replace Flutter Mane and Chien-Pao.\nI thought about\nArcanine\nas a good allrounder and Intimidate switch in for Palafin, but didn\u2019t like having to use it under Rain; and\nWeavile\nsimply because of how similar it is to Chien-Pao.\nAfter a lot of thought, I decided I would go for\nMeowscarada\ninstead of Weavile. This was really more my gut telling me to go for it rather than me thinking it was the best choice, and I liked the idea of trying to make a starter work at the very first tournament. Meowscarada crucially improved my Gastrodon (and less importantly Dondozo) matchup by a lot and also had a stronger Dark-type move in Knock Off.\nI really wanted Ice Spinner on one of my Pok\u00e9mon, but I just couldn\u2019t fit it on my team since\nGholdengo\ncame to mind as a good replacement for Flutter Mane. With a Choice Scarf it could deal spread damage and threaten Dragapult which might see more use with Flutter Mane being gone.\nSettling on Meowscarada and Gholdengo as the two replacements, I eventually decided to run Grassy Terrain on the former as my sole way of\nterrain control\n. It could theoretically also help me against Garchomp\u2019s Earthquake and increase Flower Trick\u2019s damage in combination with Overgrow, which I could take advantage of thanks to Focus Sash. Needless to say, knowing all my opponents would get my team sheet and see that I was running Grassy Terrain was an argument against it.\nSo that was my final team: Palafin, Pelipper, Kilowattrel, Amoonguss, Meowscarada and Gholdengo. I didn\u2019t have high hopes, since it felt like I just somewhat patched up my old team that broke apart, and so I went into the tournament just hoping to get the most out of a fun combination of new Pok\u00e9mon.\nOverall, a Rain team seemed like a good anti-meta call since I expected to see Torkoal everywhere, and every weather seemed somewhat viable.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nPalafin\n@ Choice Band\nAbility: Zero to Hero\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Flip Turn\n\u2013 Jet Punch\n\u2013 Wave Crash\n\u2013 Close Combat\nThe star of the team,\nPalafin\n, turned out to be as effective as it is straightforward. I used\nJet Punch\n99% of the time, except for the odd turn 1\nFlip Turn\nif I knew I could get it out alive. Most of the time that risk didn\u2019t seem worth taking however.\nClose Combat\nis only there to deal the most possible damage to Gastrodon, since against every other Water-type resist you still get more damage with\nWave Crash\n.\nA hard switch on turn 1 was usually my best bet, because Palafin also gets bulkier after it transforms so I really didn\u2019t want it to take a hit before that.\nI didn\u2019t see the need for any\nSpeed\nEVs and ultimately its\nbulk\nwas essential to it surviving and taking out several opposing Pok\u00e9mon, as was usually the gameplan.\nPalafin is the main\nTerastallization\nuser and it rarely hurts to use the extra strength right away, even before it transforms.\nPelipper\n@ Damp Rock\nAbility: Drizzle\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGround\nEVs: 76 HP / 252 SpA / 180 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Hurricane\n\u2013 Hydro Pump\n\u2013 Tailwind\n\u2013 Wide Guard\nThe question when using Palafin is: what can you switch it into? For me the best possible option is a Pok\u00e9mon with\nDrizzle\n. An Intimidate switch-in sounds nice on paper, but nothing beats giving Palafin an extra 50% to its damage output. Focus Sash was always taken by another Pok\u00e9mon, so I just went for\nDamp Rock\nand I was not disappointed. Those 3 extra turns of Rain probably won me a lot of games, and for this team it is definitely the best item to give\nPelipper\n. Also, Pelipper doesn\u2019t really mind going down on switch in, since you can immediately bring out Palafin again.\nHurricane\nhelps a lot against Grass types (notably Amoonguss) and just to chip things into range for Jet Punch (this is a common thread throughout the whole team).\nHydro Pump\ngives Pelipper a strong offensive presence.\nTailwind\nis there to help the other attackers stay on top of the opponent speedwise, and take advantage of Protects.\nWide Guard\nis great for dealing with Armarouge, Sylveon and for example Garchomp, which often only ran Rock Slide and Earthquake as its attacking moves.\nThe EV spread would let it deal big\ndamage\nand\nspeed-creep\nPok\u00e9mon that were EVd to outspeed Dragapult after Tailwind.\nKilowattrel\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Competitive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Thunder\n\u2013 Hurricane\n\u2013 Discharge\nKilowattrel\nwas overall the least reliable Pok\u00e9mon and saw the least usage. That being said, it found its place on the team thanks to its high natural\nSpeed\nand its ability to hit Water-type resists for big damage. It is also the main reason I ran Ground Tera Type on Pelipper, so it could\nDischarge\nnext to it, but Wide Guard on Pelipper turned out to be good enough for that purpose.\nI found\nSteel\nto be the best Tera Type, since it struggles with Extreme Speed and Ice Shard and the key to making Kilowattrel work was finding a way to make it stay on the field for more than one turn.\nAmoonguss\n@ Wiki Berry\nAbility: Regenerator\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD\nSassy Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Rage Powder\n\u2013 Spore\n\u2013 Clear Smog\n\u2013 Giga Drain\nPutting\nAmoonguss\non the team was a no-brainer, since I needed a way to redirect moves targeted at my damage machine Palafin and something to deal with Dondozo. I originally ran\nPollen Puff\ninstead of\nGiga Drain\n, but decided it was more important to have several ways of dealing with Gastrodon.\nAmoonguss was also a perfect switch-in for Palafin thanks to its Grass- and Electric-type resistance. I wasn\u2019t sure if the\nEV spread\nwas the best and I had no clear idea what attacks I wanted it to take, but I decided to lean more into\nSpecial Defense\nin order to deal better with Sylveon.\nGholdengo\n@ Choice Scarf\nAbility: Good as Gold\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 52 HP / 252 SpA / 204 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Make It Rain\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Thunderbolt\nGholdengo\n\u2019s purpose was mostly as a lead next to Palafin that could pave its way to success by chipping opponents into range for Jet Punch with its strong spread move,\nMake It Rain\n. I also liked that it gets access to\nThunderbolt\n, so I could have more damage against Water types. The\nChoice Scarf\nand the\nSpeed\nEVs were there to deal with Dragapult.\nIn the end I see a lot of potential for improving Gholdengo\u2019s set, since the Choice Scarf Speed boost got nullified more often than not by opposing Tailwind and it didn\u2019t take hits as well as I thought it could.\nMeowscarada\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Overgrow\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 12 HP / 252 Atk / 244 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Flower Trick\n\u2013 Knock Off\n\u2013 Grassy Terrain\nThe last piece of the team had the big responsibility of being my main Gastrodon answer and could\nTerastallize\ninto a type (the second in my team) immune to Final Gambit, Extreme Speed and Fake Out. I also found\nGhost\nto be perfect, since it would turn the tables against Bug- and Fighting-type moves, while being weak to types that were resisted by Dark. Since I only ran Grass- and Dark-type moves, there was no need for\nProtean\nand I could profit from\nOvergrow\nreally easily thanks to its\nFocus Sash\n. Once again,\nGrassy Terrain\nwas only really there to remove Psychic Terrain.\nWith 12 HP EVs, it had an\nHP stat divisible by 3\nwhich was optimal for Overgrow, but I really should have maxed out its\nSpeed\nfor the Meowscarada mirror. I just didn\u2019t expect it to be something I\u2019d need and therefore only cared about outspeeding Cyclizar and +2 Dondozo.\nTournament run\nThis was my run at the\n2023 Stuttgart Regionals VG Side Event\n!\nSwiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nTL\nR1\nWin\nIndy Anais\n(Envoy of Bacon)\nR2\nWin\nGeorg Lang\n(\nNorin\n)\nR3\nLoss\nJannis Hermann\n(Jannis)\nR4\nWLW\nTim Kukulski\n(\nTK\n)\nR5\nWin\nThomas Gravouille\n(\nHari\n)\nTop cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nTL\nTop 8\nWin\nJannis Hermann\n(Jannis)\nTop 4\nWin\nThomas Gravouille\n(\nHari\n)\nFinals\nLWL\nMarkus Stadter\n(\nYoshi\n)\nConclusion\nAs I expected, Palafin flew a bit\nunder the radar\nbefore this early-meta tournament and I could surprise my opponents with Jet Punch\u2019s damage output. That\u2019s probably one of the reasons\nI performed so well\nin my first VGC tournament. Another one could be that I knew from the beginning what I wanted to use and had\ntime to get a lot of practice in\n, while others might have had to completely scrap their plans after the bans were announced.\nSomething I learned during the tournament is that this team has to be able to function without Palafin. I faced an absolute nightmare matchup when I played against\nJannis Hermann\nin round 3 of Swiss and that\u2019s where I got my only loss in those 5 rounds. I realized I couldn\u2019t win against both Gastrodon and Indeedee, if I brought Palafin. When I faced him again in Top 8, I decided to do what I hadn\u2019t really prepared for and relied on the rest of my team to be balanced enough to be able to win.\nIn Top 4 I went up against\nThomas Gravouille\n(\nHari\n) and struggled against his two Pok\u00e9mon with Grass Tera Type in Talonflame and Gyarados. Kilowattrel was essential in this matchup and its Steel Tera Type came in clutch against Gengar. Ultimately, I also got lucky with a crit Jet Punch against Gyarados and moved on to finals. This set showed me Grass types were still big trouble for my team, since they ignored my Amoonguss and threatened my Palafin and it was hard to keep Kilowattrel around in order to deal with them.\nIn Grand Finals, I was definitely thrown off guard by\nMarkus Stadter\n\u2018s Murkrow surviving Jet Punch and 2HKOing Palafin with Foul Play in return. I think I did a decent job at adapting to Markus\u2019s gameplan in game 2 and managed to tie 1-1. In the heat of the moment, I didn\u2019t have the foresight to prepare for his Maushold to come out and wreck my team in game 3, but that\u2019s definitely where my lack of experience showed and\nI will keep this lesson in mind\nat my next competition.\nYou might also like...\nStream details and caster lineup for Bologna Special Event have been announced!\nThe last event of the season in Europe is streamed on 1\u20132 June, with Charlie Merriman, Jamie Boyt, Lee Provost and Markus Stadter as casters.\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez\n28 May, 2024\nDavid Rodr\u00edguez is the 2024 Mexico City Special Event Champion!\n2024 LAIC semifinalist David Rodr\u00edguez has won his fourth Special Event title!
