I\u2019m 21 years old and I live in Thailand being half Korean. Although I\u2019m still new to offline competitive tournaments, I\u2019ve been actively participating in online and team tournaments where I\u2019ve gained valuable experience. I was also part of the\nThailand national team\nthat\nwon the\n2022\u00a0World Cup of Pok\u00e9mon VGC\norganised by Victory Road\u2014it was an amazing experience and incredible journey.\nThank you for taking the time to read my team report, and I hope you enjoy it!\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nIn the past, I\u2019ve missed several opportunities, including the\n2022 Thailand National Championship\n. At the time, I was preoccupied with preparing for my school graduation, which made it difficult for me to participate. However, this experience motivated me to push myself beyond my limits and work harder to make up for what I missed last year.\nHowever, when I had the opportunity to participate in the\n2023 Thailand National Championship\n, the rules had changed to an\nonline qualifier\nplus a\nlive event\nfor 64 players in the region. The format consisted of\nbest-of-1 single elimination\n, with\nonly the top 4 finalists earning an\ninvitation\nto Yokohama. These rule changes had a significant impact on various aspects of the competition, including my mentality and the need to adapt to new strategies and countermeasures. In other words, the margin for error was incredibly narrow, and even the slightest mistake could mean missing out on the World Championship. With that in mind, let\u2019s shift our focus to the team!\nMy main stage team is a total game-changer\u2014a modified version of the original online qualifier team, with\nAmoonguss\ntaking the place of Talonflame. This powerhouse squad is the ultimate counter against the Thailand meta to devastate the teams like those based on\nMausApe\n(Maushold + Annihilape), Dondozo, and Tailwind\u00a0cores.\nThe core of this incredible team was inspired by the sheer potential that\nChaiyawat Traiwichcha\nand I saw in the combination of\nChien-Pao\nand\nDragonite\n. These two Pok\u00e9mon make an unstoppable late-game sweeping duo, especially with\nDragonite\u2019s Normal Tera Type-boosted Extreme Speed\n!\nHaving an unstoppable late-game sweeper is essential in this team, but it\u2019s just as important to have a Pok\u00e9mon that can deal explosive damage early on. That\u2019s where none other than\nFlutter Mane\ncomes into my thoughts as a meme \u201cEverywhere I go, I see his face\u201d; and to cause more disasters, I added\nChi-Yu\n.\nIf you\u2019re looking for the heart and soul of the hyper-offensive team, you should look no further than the speed-controlling Pok\u00e9mon that make it all possible. And for mine, it is\nIron Bundle\n\u2014my favorite Paradox. At first, I thought Iron Bundle would simply serve as a speed control for my team. It turns out the Pok\u00e9mon contributed so much as a carry. This Iron Bundle is really unique among others which I hope it catches your attention to continue reading\u2026\nAs said earlier, I chose to replace\nTalonflame\nwith\nturbo\nAmoonguss\nto make the team more flexible.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nT\u2019Challa\n(Chien-Pao) @ Focus Sash\nAbility: Sword of Ruin\nTera Type:\nGhost\nJolly Nature\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\n\u2013 Ice Spinner\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Sacred Sword\n\u2013 Protect\nWhen it comes to our late game sweeper, there\u2019s really not much to say about\nChien-Pao\n\u2014its 252 Attack, Speed, and\nJolly Nature\nare pretty standard. But don\u2019t be fooled\u2014this Pok\u00e9mon is a true standout on its own. Chien-Pao\u2019s unique Dark/Ice typing, paired with its Sword of Ruin ability, make it one of the most feared Pok\u00e9mon on the field.\nPairing Chien-Pao with a\nDragonite\ncreates a formidable offensive combination. Additionally, in my opinion, Chien-Pao\u2019s\nGhost Tera Type\nprovides the best protection against Fake Out, Fighting-type attacks, and Extreme Speed.\nBar B Gon\n(Dragonite) @ Choice Band\nAbility: Multiscale\nTera Type:\nNormal\nAdamant Nature\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\n\u2013 Extreme Speed\n\u2013 Aqua Jet\n\u2013 Aerial Ace\n\u2013 Outrage\nWhen considering the ideal partner for Chien-Pao,\nDragonite\nstands out as an excellent choice. It can throw off incredibly strong physical moves, especially\nExtreme Speeds\nwhen paired with Normal-type Terastallization and Sword of Ruin.\nDragonite is incredibly powerful with\nMultiscale\n, even 4-times effective Ice-type moves (excluding Chien-Pao\u2019s Ice Spinner and Icicle Crash) won\u2019t be enough to stop it. But what really sets this Dragonite apart is the\n252 Speed EV\ninvestment, as you\u2019ll be able to outspeed Dragonite\u2019s mirror and bulky Follow Me Maushold.\nNezuko\n(Flutter Mane) @ Choice Specs\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nTera Type:\nFairy\nTimid Nature\nEVs: 164 HP / 196 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 140 Spe\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Moonblast\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Thunderbolt\nThe combination of\nChoice Specs Flutter Mane\nand Chi-Yu\u2019s Beads of Ruin is just nasty on this team. I really appreciate\nTang Shiliang\nfor generously sharing his advice on optimizing Flutter Mane\u2019s usage, as it has greatly impacted my team\u2019s performance in the tournament.\nTo add on, this Flutter Mane is always guaranteed to\noutspeed\nModest max Speed Flutter Mane and Roaring Moon. Therefore the reason for\nThunderbolt\nis to remove Gyarados or punishing Water-Tera Type Gholdengo and Amoonguss.\nDefensive calcs\n164 HP / 196 Def Flutter Mane vs.\n252+ Atk Sword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nIcicle Crash\n: 121-144 (80.1 \u2013 95.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n164 HP / 196 Def Flutter Mane vs.\n252+ Atk Mystic Water Tera-Water\nPalafin-Hero\nJet Punch\n: 126-150 (83.4 \u2013 99.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n164 HP / 196 Def Flutter Mane vs.\n252 Atk\nGreat Tusk\nHeadlong Rush\n: 124-147 (82.1 \u2013 97.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nU CAN\u2019T C ME\n(Chi-Yu) @ Leftovers\nAbility: Beads of Ruin\nTera Type:\nGrass\nTimid Nature\nEVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Heat Wave\n\u2013 Dark Pulse\n\u2013 Substitute\n\u2013 Protect\nChi-Yu\nis a fascinating Pok\u00e9mon on this team, primarily due to its Dark/Fire typing that offers defensive advantages against Prankster users and its ability Beads of Ruin. I decided to Terastallize into a\nGrass\ntype to cover its weaknesses into Palafin\u2019s Jet Punch and Ting-Lu\u2019s Stomping Tantrum which could be OHKOs.\nAs I previously mentioned, Chi-Yu and Flutter Mane form a great offensive duo, and Chi-Yu also plays a crucial role in\neliminating Gholdengo and Annihilape\n. I added Substitute to Chi-Yu as it proved to be helpful in certain situations. Giving Chi-Yu Leftovers allows it to maintain Substitute and disturb the opponent.\n\u51b0\u6dc7\u6dcb\n(Iron Bundle) @ Booster Energy\nAbility: Quark Drive\nTera Type:\nPoison\nTimid Nature\nEVs: 236 HP / 12 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Freeze-Dry\n\u2013 Icy Wind\n\u2013 Hydro Pump\n\u2013 Protect\nIron Bundle\n: My Ultimate Paradox Pick! With its\nIcy Wind\nmove for speed control, this bad boy has helped this team to dominate the competition. I trained its EVs to keep it on the field longer and support my team like a champ. Plus, it\u2019s the only Poison Tera Type in the tournament (besides\nPitchapat Chinnarasri\n[\nPleng\u266a\n]\u00a0who also used my team)\u2014this Iron Bundle can handle anything thrown its way!\nDefensive calcs\n236 HP / 12 Def Iron Bundle vs.\n252+ Atk Choice Band Sword of Ruin Tera-Normal\nDragonite\nExtreme Speed\n: 135-160 (83.8 \u2013 99.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n236 HP / 12 Def Iron Bundle vs.\n252+ Atk Sword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nSacred Sword\n: 126-150 (78.2 \u2013 93.1%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n236 HP / 4 SpD Iron Bundle vs.\n252+ SpA Beads of Ruin\nChi-Yu\nHeat Wave\n: 135-159 (83.8 \u2013 98.7%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n236 HP / 12 Def Iron Bundle vs.\n236+ Atk\nIron Hands\nDrain Punch\n: 132-156 (81.9 \u2013 96.8%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nTao Kae Noi\n(Amoonguss) @ Sitrus Berry\nAbility: Regenerator\nTera Type:\nWater\nBold Nature\nEVs: 252 HP / 116 Def / 140 Spe\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Spore\n\u2013 Rage Powder\n\u2013 Pollen Puff\n\u2013 Protect\nIn terms of defensive support,\nAmoonguss\nis hands down the best choice for our team. What sets this particular Amoonguss apart is its impressive\nSpeed\n, that I actually count to outpace the Ting-Lu builds with a 4 and 12 EV investment in Speed.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t end up utilizing Amoonguss much during the tournament, simply having it on the team preview was enough to make my opponents second-guess their strategy and play into the mind games.\nDefensive calcs\n252 HP / 116 Def Amoonguss vs.\n252 Atk Sword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nIce Spinner\n\u2014 guaranteed 2HKO after Sitrus Berry recovery\nHow to use the team\nThis team is created to be accessible to everyone and is built for\nhyper-offensive play\n. Simply just click the button! Keep in mind that the more damage you deal, the easier it will be for\nChien-Pao\nand\nDragonite\nto secure the victory.\nFor the best results\n, lead with a pair of special attackers that can handle against the matchups and deal significant damage. These Pok\u00e9mon are the backbone of the strategy, setting the tone for the rest of the battle. And to wrap up the game, simply bring in Chien-Pao and Dragonite\nto finish off\nyour opponent.\nCommon leads\nLeads\nAttitude Adjustments\nWhat is he cooking?\nI've got no choice\nLeads\nClick on the tabs to see some notes!\nAttitude Adjustments\nThe combination of\nFlutter Mane + Iron Bundle\nis the most effective lead for this team in terms of\nspeed control and damage output\n. Additionally, this pairing is particularly effective at countering teams that feature Dondozo and Palafin.\nWhat is he cooking?\nFlutter Mane + Chi-Yu\nis the most effective solution for countering\nMausApe\n(Maushold + Annihilape) and other threats. This pairing works particularly well when Flutter Mane is equipped with\nChoice Specs\nand is used alongside Chi-Yu. In addition, the capability of Chi-Yu to\nSubstitute\nincreases the flexibility of this lead strategy, providing opportunities to explore various options.\nI've got no choice\nFlutter Mane +\nturbo\nAmoonguss\nis the only viable countermeasure against Dondozo + Ting-Lu, and Sand teams.\nCommon threats\nThreats\nSand teams\nIntimidate\nGhost-type Pok\u00e9mon\nThreats\nClick on the tabs to see some notes!\nSand teams\nSand teams\nare tough for my team, as four of my Pok\u00e9mon are weak to Rock. Opponents who\nlead with Tyranitar + Lycanroc\ncan spam Rock Slide to deal heavy damage and disrupt my strategy.\nCounterplay\n: For this matchup, I suggest leading with a\nFlutter Mane + Amoonguss\nduo, using Dazzling Gleam + Spore into Lycanroc. Importantly, pray that both Pok\u00e9mon will not flinch.\nIntimidate\nIntimidate\nposes a challenge for this team.\nChien-Pao\nand\nDragonite\nare strong sweepers, but Intimidate can weaken them. It\u2019s important to take out Intimidate users early to avoid disruption.\nCounterplay\n: To counter Intimidate users, I\nlead with Flutter Mane + Chi-Yu\n, carefully selecting Flutter Mane\u2019s moves and using Substitute with Chi-Yu. This maintains a strong position, even if Flutter Mane is OHKO\u2019d in turn 1. It also creates an opportunity for\nDragonite\nto potentially switch in.\nWhen faced with\nGyarados + Ting-Lu\n, I mostly predict the opponent\u2019s moves by using\nThunderbolt\non Gyarados +\nSubstitute\nwith Chi-Yu as usual. Even if they protect Gyarados and target Flutter Mane with a Heavy Slam, it is a calculated risk to bait for a free Substitute.\nGhost-type Pok\u00e9mon\nWhile this may be\nless difficult\nthan the previous threats mentioned, it\u2019s still crucial to have a Pok\u00e9mon on the team that can effectively\ncounter\nthem.\nCounterplay\n: Although I usually prefer to lead with\nFlutter Mane\nin most matchups, if facing a team with at least two Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon, I would place it at the back to serve as a counter. Alternatively, if I must lead with it, I always prioritize preserving it for later use.\nTournament run\nThis was my run at the\nThailand National Championship\n!\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 64\nW\nBye\nTop 32\nW\nlg\nI don\u2019t remember lg\u2019s team\n(CTS)\nTop 16\nW\nTanat\nLeelapaiboonsakul\n(Kirito)\n(OTS)\nTop 8\nW\nNattanon Wongwiwatchai\n(\nboomngong\n)\nTop 4\nL\nPanyawut Noijan\n(\nRizaya\n)\nConclusion\nAs a player, I believe in not setting my expectations too high, with the notion that\n\u201cno expectation = no disappointment\u201d\n. When I entered this tournament, I didn\u2019t expect to make it very far. However, despite the challenges of a\nbest-of-1 single-elimination\nformat, I gave it my all in every match, defying all odds and surpassing all expectations. Through my dedication, I have proven that anything is possible. I\u2019m grateful for all the opportunities and challenges that have come my way, and I look forward to pushing myself further in the future, both as a person and as a player. With\nhard work\n,\ndedication\n, and\nrespect\nfor my opponents, I\u2019m confident that I can achieve great things.\nTalking about the tournament, I thought I had the perfect\ncounter\nagainst Thailand\u2019s meta. But when I saw their defensive and balanced team build, I knew I was in trouble. I had to play smartly, putting myself in advantageous positions and relying on my EVs trained to come through in clutch moments. And they did! No regrets using this team though\u2014it\ntook me to rank No. 1\nin Pokemon Showdown!\nMoreover, I sincerely hope\nTPC\ntakes this issue seriously. It is disappointing to see so many players have been affected by this kind of competition. We all put in so much effort for a tournament that only happens\nonce a year\n, and to lose our chance to compete due to an unfair system is truly devastating. It is our hope that this situation will lead to more\nimprovements in the future\n, so that\nall players have an equal and fair chance\nto participate in these events.\nIn closing, I would like to\nexpress\nmy heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has supported me, especially my family and the Thailand community. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to connect with so many talented VGC players from all around the world. Without our paths crossing, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today. Their kindness and willingness to share their knowledge and expertise have been invaluable, and I\u2019m grateful for all the lessons I have learned from them. I look forward to continuing to grow and improve with their guidance.\nThank you all so much for everything!\nYou might also like...\nStream details and caster lineup for Bologna Special Event have been announced!\nThe last event of the season in Europe is streamed on 1\u20132 June, with Charlie Merriman, Jamie Boyt, Lee Provost and Markus Stadter as casters.\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez\n28 May, 2024\nDavid Rodr\u00edguez is the 2024 Mexico City Special Event Champion!\n2024 LAIC semifinalist David Rodr\u00edguez has won his fourth Special Event title!
