My name is\nAlexander D\u2019Andrea\n, also known as\n1exar\n, but you can just call me\nLex\n. I am 22 years old from New Jersey, and I have been playing a form of Pok\u00e9mon since 2008. I started out with the TCG in which I qualified for three World Championships, cut numerous regionals, and won dozens of locals. After I headed off to college in 2018 I took a break from Pok\u00e9mon, but after graduating back last May, I looked for a return to competitive gaming.\nCome December 2022, I decided to pick up a copy of\nViolet\nand play it for some nostalgia, little did I know I would find out there was an in-game ladder and quickly became addicted. Soon enough I was looking up VGC guides on teambuilding and EV training. Fast forward four months and I was able to get\nTop 4\nat my first tournament, the\n2023 European International Championships\n! The team I brought was a unique take on the Dondozo archetype, and I am incredibly excited to break it down and explore what makes it tick.\nBefore I get started, I want to shout out\nChuppa Cross\n,\nCarson Confer\n, and\nFrancesco Pero\n. They were all incredibly instrumental in the building process and kept me motivated throughout the event. I also did a breakdown on\nTubNation\u2019s YouTube channel\nand I recommend checking that out as well!\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nI had played no tours in\nRegulation Sets A or B\n, not even online or a grassroots one, so as soon as the\nRegulation Set C ladder\ndropped I hopped on Showdown and started playing around. The big question on many people\u2019s minds was, which of the Ruin Pok\u00e9mon would you want to build around? Some people opted for Ting-Lu balance teams, others for offensive Chien-Pao teams, and over 50% of people at EUIC used the best Ruin Pok\u00e9mon:\nAmoonguss\n. When I started building for Regulation Set C, I was extremely and still am inexperienced at it, so I started looking for Regulation Set B teams to adapt into the Regulation Set C format. That is when I found\nNeil Patel\n\u2018s (\nNeilVGC\n)\nVancouver Regional Top 8 team\n.\nI took his team, kept it exactly the same and even had the EVs as I am a proud NeilVGC Patreon subscriber, but made one critical change swapping\nChi-Yu\nin for Great Tusk. I immediately went from struggling in the 1400s to peaking at an ELO of 1850 in the matter of two days on the Showdown ladder. Quickly, I messaged Neil and said \u201chey you know your Van team plus Chi-Yu is kinda insane,\u201d he responded that he also thought it was quite good and had been experimenting with it himself for\nEUIC\n, which made me confident I had found something solid to work with.\nAround this time, I began working with\nChuppa Cross\nfor 1-on-1 coaching to improve my fundamentals as I wanted to go into EUIC having a decent shot to end with a positive record, which was my main goal for my first tournament. He helped me tweak the team and EVs, and eventually on Sunday I had what I thought would be my final version of the team. That was until Chuppa himself took such a liking to the team that he was strongly considering using it for EUIC as well. He asked if he could use my team on ladder, to which I had no problem with, and he introduced me to someone who had swiped the team off of me accepting OTS on Showdown and was also planning on using it.\nTo summarize here are all the big changes we made to Neil\u2019s original team:\nChoice Band\n> Lum Berry Dragonite. This allows our Dragonite to put insane physical pressure on the opponent and threaten Normal Tera Type-boosted Extreme Speed OHKOs on any non bulky Pok\u00e9mon. Additionally it takes advantage of opposing Chien-Pao\u2019s as Normal-Tera Type Dragonite can often get 2-3 attacks off before it is dealt with and absorb all the pressure, allowing the Pok\u00e9mon sitting next to it to attack relatively unscathed.\nMax Speed EVs\non Dragonite. This lets our Dragonite win every Extreme Speed tie and 1v1 late-game Palafin with ease. Additionally, it allows our Iron Bundle to combo Icy Wind with an attack from Dragonite much easier.\nIce\n> Ghost Tera Type on Iron Bundle. Ice Tera Type-boosted Freeze-Dry allowed us to comfortably pick up OHKOs on opposing Amoonguss and resist opposing Iron Bundle\u2019s Freeze-Dry.\nMax Speed EVs\non Dondozo. Half of the Flutter Mane are running below 174 Speed, which allows our Dondozo to just pick it up with Wave Crash or Tera Blast with ease and not have to worry about taking any damage in response.\nChi-Yu\n> Great Tusk. Chi-Yu is easily my favorite Ruin Pok\u00e9mon, as if you position it correctly it can completely run over a game. Combined with Iron Bundle you have deadly Icy Wind + Overheat combos that pick up basically any Pok\u00e9mon in the game that doesn\u2019t resist.\nKey Dondozo\nchanges\nthat I will save for a more in depth explanation shortly.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nGlimmora\n@ Assault Vest\nAbility: Toxic Debris\nTera Type:\nGrass\nBold Nature\nEVs: 252 HP / 156 Def / 100 SpD\n\u2013 Mortal Spin\n\u2013 Power Gem\n\u2013 Earth Power\n\u2013 Energy Ball\nThe entire reason I was drawn to the team to begin with, Glimmora is incredibly annoying to deal with and is strong into a lot of matchups that the core of Iron Bundle + Chi-Yu and\nDozogiri\nis not. The goal of Glimmora is to\nMortal Spin and proc Toxic Debris\nwith your own Dragonite via Extreme Speed or Earthquake (Grass-Tera Type Glimmora) and then swap in Dondozo and slowly stall out opponents by alternating between attack and protect as they die to poison. While I wish I could say I made a lot of use of Glimmora at EUIC, it was mostly irrelevant as I played almost entirely Balance teams during the tourney, a matchup in which it is not common to bring Glimmora.\nDragonite\n@ Choice Band\nAbility: Multiscale\nTera Type:\nNormal\nAdamant Nature\nEVs: 44 HP / 204 Atk / 4 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\n\u2013 Outrage\n\u2013 Ice Spinner\n\u2013 Extreme Speed\n\u2013 Earthquake\nDragonite\nserves as a means to accelerate the pace of the game\n. When I ran into a team that had a particularly good Dondozo counter or had a very specific strategy that I did not think I could break with Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle, the strategy that is best is to just hit them incredibly hard and fast. When you click Normal Tera Type-boosted Extreme Speed with Choice Band, you are saying to your opponent \u201call of your Pok\u00e9mon are on a 2-attack clock; deal with Dragonite or lose the Pok\u00e9mon of my choice\u201d. Outrage allows you to beat any beefy attacker like Ting-Lu or Iron Hands, which Iron Bundle and Chi-Yu struggle with. Ice Spinner is for the random Psychic Terrain I might face, and Earthquake was good coverage and a way to set Toxic Debris if needed.\nOffensive calcs\n204+ Atk Choice Band Tera Normal Dragonite\nExtreme Speed\nvs. 4 HP / 0 Def Chi-Yu: 135-159 (103 \u2013 121.3%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nChi-Yu\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Beads of Ruin\nTera Type:\nGhost\nTimid Nature\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Overheat\n\u2013 Heat Wave\n\u2013 Dark Pulse\n\u2013 Protect\nChi-Yu is absolutely busted, this Pok\u00e9mon can pressure basically every single Pok\u00e9mon in the format aside from Ting-Lu, which this team has plenty of other ways to deal with. The main Pok\u00e9mon you lead with Chi-Yu is Iron Bundle. All Chi-Yu needs to be an insane threat is a bit of speed, and Iron Bundle\u2019s Icy Wind provides that along with the chip to let Overheat pick up the Pok\u00e9mon of your choice. Additionally, Chi-Yu and Iron Bundle have a unique advantage in that\nthey cover Fire + Water + Grass cores spectacularly well\n, as Hydro Pump hits Fire types, Heat Wave and Freeze-Dry hit Grass types and Water types. The most common defensive Tera Types are Grass and Water in this format, and Chi-Yu + Iron Bundle threaten both the base and Tera typing of most of those Pok\u00e9mon. All I can say is good luck resisting both hits from the duo.\nOffensive calcs\nJust two to give an example of Overheat + Icy Wind potency\u2026\n252 SpA Beads of Ruin Chi-Yu\nOverheat\nvs. 100 HP / 4 SpD Baxcalibur: 171-202 (84.2 \u2013 99.5%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 SpA Beads of Ruin Iron Bundle\nIcy Wind\nvs. 100 HP / 4 SpD Baxcalibur: 51-61 (25.1 \u2013 30%) \u2014 guaranteed 4HKO\n252 SpA Beads of Ruin Chi-Yu\nOverheat\nvs. 100 HP / 4 SpD Flutter Mane: 118-139 (82.5 \u2013 97.2%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 SpA Beads of Ruin Iron Bundle\nIcy Wind\nvs. 100 HP / 4 SpD Flutter Mane: 34-42 (23.7 \u2013 29.3%) \u2014 99.1% chance to 4HKO\nIron Bundle\n@ Booster Energy\nAbility: Quark Drive\nTera Type:\nIce\nTimid Nature\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Hydro Pump\n\u2013 Icy Wind\n\u2013 Freeze-Dry\n\u2013 Protect\nThere is not much to say about Iron Bundle that I have not already mentioned in tandem with Chi-Yu. Iron Bundle serves as the main way to deal with Dondozo as ours is Oblivious. Additionally, it is a fantastic Amoonguss checker as they practically all have Water Tera Type, and those that have Steel Tera Type just drop to Chi-Yu. Once again, the Ice Tera Type picks up the KO on most Amoonguss.\nOffensive calcs\n252 SpA Tera Ice Beads of Ruin Iron Bundle\nFreeze-Dry\nvs. 244 HP / 76+ SpD Amoonguss: 204-244 (92.7 \u2013 110.9%) \u2014 62.5% chance to OHKO\n252 SpA Tera Ice Beads of Ruin Iron Bundle\nIcy Wind\n(60 BP) vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Great Tusk: 216-256 (113 \u2013 134%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252 SpA Tera Ice Beads of Ruin Iron Bundle\nFreeze-Dry\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Iron Bundle: 156-184 (118.1 \u2013 139.3%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252 SpA Tera Ice Beads of Ruin Iron Bundle\nFreeze-Dry\nvs. +2 4 HP / 172 SpD Dondozo: 116-140 (51.3 \u2013 61.9%) \u2014 97.3% chance to 2HKO\nafter Leftovers recovery\nDondozo\n@ Leftovers\nAbility: Oblivious\nTera Type:\nGrass\nAdamant Nature\nEVs: 4 HP / 76 Atk / 4 Def / 172 SpD / 252 Spe\n\u2013 Wave Crash\n\u2013 Earthquake\n\u2013 Tera Blast\n\u2013 Protect\nDondozo: the heart and soul of the team, but with a twist! Nearly every single Dondozo outside of\nNick Navarre\n\u2018s (\nNails\n) solo Dondozo in Top 8 of\nFort Wayne\nhas run the same ability, Unaware. It makes sense why, it makes your +2 omni-boosted Dondozo basically unkillable and the opponent cannot get around it with setup. However, in Regulation Set C, when I looked at the meta and kind of teams that were dominant, setup such as Swords Dance and Nasty Plot were scarce. People opted in favor of pure outright damage with\nChien-Pao\nand\nChi-Yu\n, along with Choice Band and Choice Specs users. While they still back quite a punch, +2 omni-boosted Dondozo can still tank 3-4 of these hits with the right defensive investment and positioning. Additionally, with the overall quantity of Dondozo\u2019s falling, Unaware, which is highly essential for the mirror, drops in importance even more. So I looked for a better ability to fit onto Dondozo for EUIC. Nearly every\nPalafin balance\nplayer had simply opted for Intimidate cycling into Haze as their Dondozo counter. It turns out Dondozo has a very handy Ability versus Intimidate,\nOblivious\n, which simply lets Dondozo ignore the Intimidate all together. Combine that with Grass Tera Type and Tera Blast and you will nuke any Palafin while ignoring all Spores and Rage Powders. Wave Crash and Earthquake are the other chosen moves, respectively for massive single-target STAB and solid spread damage.\nTatsugiri\n@ Choice Scarf\nAbility: Commander\nTera Type:\nSteel\nTimid Nature\nEVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Draco Meteor\n\u2013 Muddy Water\n\u2013 Icy Wind\n\u2013 Sleep Talk\nTo round off the team Tatsugiri is the counterpart to Dondozo allowing it to get its +2 omni-boost with\nCommander\n. While a lot of people view Tatsugiri as a Pok\u00e9mon that is kind of useless outside of letting Dondozo take KOs left and right, it functioned much different on this team. Being that we could preserve Chi-Yu from the early game thanks to Focus Sash, we are able to get quite deadly endgames with 1 HP Chi-Yu next to Tatsugiri firing off strong Muddy Waters and Draco Meteors.\nHow to use the team\nMatchups\nPalafin balance\nHyper-offense Tailwind (Talonflame)\nHyper-offense Tailwind (Murkrow)\nHard Trick Room\nLilligant + Torkoal\nDondozo mirror\nMatchups\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about how to face these matchups!\nPalafin balance\nLead\nDondozo + Iron Bundle, with Chi-Yu and Tatsugiri\nin the back.\nThis team was designed to beat the common\nbalance\nteams, as that was what we expected to be the most common threat. They often lead\nTing-Lu + Palafin\nas they want to make sure they can safely pull back their Haze counter and neutralize a Chi-Yu + Iron Bundle lead with Ting-Lu. By leading\nDondozo + Iron Bundle\n, you are able to Wave Crash\u00a0+ Freeze Dry to Ting-Lu. This covers for all potential switches like Flutter Mane, Amoonguss, and Arcanine. They can always Terastallize Ting-Lu, but if they waste that resource on a Pok\u00e9mon not essential to them dealing with Dondozo, they are at an extreme disadvantage moving forward, and you will still deal 50% roughly of the Terastallized Ting-Lu\u2019s HP.\nAfter you take advantage of their inexperience in game 1, they will most likely switch up their lead. Here you can catch them off guard by leading the hyper aggressive Chi-Yu + Iron Bundle or Dragonite + Iron Bundle. From there you can start firing off Overheats or Outrage next to Iron Bundle\u2019s speed control.\nHyper-offense Tailwind (Talonflame)\nLead\nDondozo + Iron Bundle, with Chi-Yu and Tatsugiri\nin the back.\nLead\nGlimmora + Iron Bundle, with Dondozo and Tatsugiri\nin the back\nTo beat hyper-offense\u00a0Tailwind\u00a0teams you need to remove the Talonflame, so the best strategy is to lead two Pok\u00e9mon that can each threaten the KO on the Talonflame. As soon as you remove the Talonflame, their Will-O-Wisp potential is gone and Dondozo can usually handle what they have in the back. If they burn Terastallization on Talonflame, it is not the end of the world because they still have to secure a kill with their other Pok\u00e9mon, and depending on what they led that isn\u2019t always possible and then you\u2019re double up on the Talonflame will still pick up the KO.\nHyper-offense Tailwind (Murkrow)\nLead\nIron Bundle + Chi-Yu, with Dondozo and Tatsugiri\nin the back\nLead\nDragonite + Glimmora, with Iron Bundle and Chi-Yu\nin the back\nMurkrow is a bit trickier, because if you get caught off guard with your special attackers vs the Murkrow next to a Flutter Mane, you won\u2019t be able to remove the Murkrow as they can very easily Tailwind and KO your Iron Bundle. A lot of mind games come down to the lead, but if you are able to KO the Murkrow before both pieces of\nDozoGiri\nhit the field, you basically cannot lose. You can also switch it up by bringing only half of the Dondozo core and threaten the swap and bait out a wasted turn of Haze from the opponent.\nHard Trick Room\nLead\nGlimmora + Dragonite, with Dondozo and Tatsugiri\nin the back\nTrick Room\ncan be tricky (haha), but the basic strategy we came up to deal with the remaining people bold enough to run it was to lead Dragonite + Glimmora. To start you would Grass-type Terastallize Glimmora and Mortal Spin + Earthquake with Dragonite. What this allows you to do is poison both opening Pok\u00e9mon and set the Toxic Spikes for the ones in the back. Next turn you can hard-swap into Dondozo and Tatsugiri and fairly easily tank whatever hit may go into the Dondozo. Then, alternating between Protect and Earthquake does not allow the opponent to get a safe switch in and eventually you should be able to Toxic-stall and clean up with the Dragonite that you have saved in the back.\nIf they are invested heavily in the Armarouge form of Trick Room you can even go for a cheeky Ice Spinner into your own Glimmora, without Terastallizing Glimmora in this instance, but the standard Mortal Spin + Earthquake could certainly still work.\nLilligant + Torkoal\nLead\nGlimmora + Dragonite, with Dondozo and Tatsugiri\nin the back\nLead\nGlimmora + Chi-Yu, with Dondozo and Tatsugiri\nin the back\nLilliKoal\ncan be very RNG-based depending on Sleep Powder accuracy and sleep turns. Both of the above leads can be strong and you should look to take out Lilligant as soon as possible. Hopefully you can weather the storm with the front two Pok\u00e9mon long enough that\nDozoGiri\ncan clean up the remaining 2-3 Pok\u00e9mon. With the Glimmora + Chi-Yu lead, your Power Gem OHKOs Torkoal, but remember this also makes your Glimmora more susceptible to Earth Power. Glimmora and Dragonite can be quite effective at removing Lilligant assuming sleep turns do not screw you over too hard.\nDondozo mirror\nLead\nDragonite + Glimmora, with Iron Bundle and Chi-Yu\nin back\nIronically, the hardest matchup for this team was the Dondozo mirror: as we opted to go with Oblivious, we could not bring our own Dondozo into any opponents with Unaware. Our strategy was to handle the first 2 Pok\u00e9mon with Dragonite + Glimmora, and if needed clean them up with Iron Bundle and Chi-Yu. Generally if Iron Bundle and Chi-Yu hit the field against Dondozo with Chi-Yu\u2019s Focus Sash still intact, they could clean up the endgame quite nicely. However, the matchup is highly volatile and largely relies on Dragonite and Glimmora to matchup well into whatever opening Pok\u00e9mon the opponent has, as it is extremely important to save Iron Bundle and Chi-Yu for the Dondozo endgame.\nThere are situations where if you think Iron Bundle + Chi-Yu can run over the game it is acceptable to lead them, but rarely is it recommended.\nTournament run\nThis was my run at\nEuropean International Championships\n!\nDay 1 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nMark Maclean\n(\nMark\n)\nR2\nLWW\nWang Shengyu\n(\n\u8389\u8389\u827e\n)\nR3\nWLW\nLeandro Sarmento\n(\nLento\n)\nR4\nWW\nMaurice Uteg\n(\nCamikasa\n)\nR5\nLWL\nJames Evans\n(\nJames\n)\nR6\nWW\nDavide Redaelli\n(Davide)\nR7\nWLW\nAaron Zheng\n(\nCybertronVGC\n)\nR8\nLWW\nSidy Badiane\n(\nDysi\n)\nR9\nWW\nFederico Camporesi\n(\nFedeCampoVGC\n)\nDay 2 Swiss Rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nWLW\nDavide Miraglia\n(\nDede\n)\nR11\nLL\nGabriel Agati\n(\nWuilber flex\n)\nR12\nWLW\nV\u00edctor Medina\n(\nTorviv\n)\nR13\nWW\nSohaib Mufti\n(\nsoh\n)\nR14\nLL\nGiulio Tarlao\n(\nGiulio\n)\nYou can watch my\nSwiss round 11 match\nversus Gabriel\nhere\n!\nTop Cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWW\nGiulio Tarlao\n(\nGiulio\n)\nTop 4\nLL\nGabriel Agat\ni\n(\nWuilber flex\n)\nYou can watch my\nTop 4 match\nversus Gabriel, a rematch from Swiss round 11,\nhere\n!\nAdvice for new players!\nI wanted to finish this report by going over my general thoughts on how to be successful as a new player.\nSet incremental goals\nI had decided going into\nEUIC\nthat my main goal was to finish with a\npositive record\nof 5-4. If I achieved that my goal would be to get to Day 2 if that was still possible, then from then on it was Top 16, etc. When you approach events like this, especially as a new player, you often take the pressure off. Many players fall into a trap of romanticizing their first few tournaments of how well they can do, however often this leads to poor performances. I did this many times as a veteran player in the TCG, and it set me up for failure. Even once you become a seasoned player, do not overburden yourself with your own expectations, at the end of the day make sure you are having fun with friends, then no matter how well you do, you are sure to have a good time.\nDo not worry about ladder rank\nThe nice thing about VGC is that the Pok\u00e9mon Showdown and in-game ladders have zero role in how you perform at tournaments.\nIt does not matter\nif you lose 300 points on Showdown testing a team for an upcoming regional, whether you are Rank 500 or Rank 1, all that matters is how you play in the regional itself. Is it nice to be high rank on the respective ladders? Yes! Should you obsess over it like I know I have at times and seen people? No!\nPlay A LOT\nIn any game, a tried and true way to improve is to\nplay\n. However, it is not as important in my opinion as this next tip.\nWatch / read A LOT\nIf you are serious about improving as a new player, you should absolutely be\nwatching every Regional you can\nand consuming as much VGC content on YouTube and websites like Victory Road. The greatest leap in ability you will make as a player is when you are an introductory-level to average-level player, you want to make sure to set yourself up for succes. The greatest help to me as a new player was watching\nNeil Patel\n\u2019s and\nJamie Boyt\n\u2019s YouTube channel guides on everything\nScarlet\nand\nViolet\n.\nIf possible, get a coach\nWhile this does require extra monetary commitment,\ngetting a coach is incredibly helpful\n. Had I not signed up for\nChuppa Cross\n\u2019s coaching, I would not have had nearly the fundamentals I needed to do as well as I did at EUIC. No matter how good your meta call is, if you do not understand the game at its core, you will not do well. Additionally, having a coach can offer many connections and access to resources you normally would not have as a new player.\nClosing words\nI just want to reiterate my deepest thanks to\nChuppa Cross\n,\nCarson Confer\n, and\nFrancesco Pio Pero\n. The three of them made my preparation for\nEUIC\nso incredibly amazing that I absolutely could not have done as well as I did without them. Best of luck to all of them in future events and I look forward to working with everyone again!\nThis whole article also would not be possible without\nVictory Road\nfor giving me the opportunity to write it!
