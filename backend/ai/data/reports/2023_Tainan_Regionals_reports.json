My name is\nTseng\nYan-rong\n, and you can also call me by my IGN\nTony\n.\nI started playing VGC in\nPok\u00e9mon Sword\n&\nPok\u00e9mon Shield\n, and after a couple of top cuts this is my best result: I am very happy to be the\nchampion\nof\nPok\u00e9mon Scarlet\n&\nPok\u00e9mon Violet\nTainan Regionals\n!\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nThis was the\nfirst competition in\nPok\u00e9mon Scarlet\n&\nPok\u00e9mon Violet\n, and the mainstream Pok\u00e9mon in Ranked Battles are a few. A player must have countermeasures and cognition about these mainstream Pok\u00e9mon. Let me talk about my thoughts below.\nFirst of all, I think that, in this environment, a high-speed combination was needed. So I needed Tailwind Pok\u00e9mon and Trick Room Pok\u00e9mon. For the Trick Room mode, I used the\nbrother-sister\ncombination of\nArmarouge\nand\nFemale Indeedee\n, which is very popular now. The Tailwind responsible is\nMurkrow\n.\nThe next slots went to the new Pok\u00e9mon\nMeowscarada\nand\nMaushold\n. I personally love Maushold and\u00a0I think both are very strong and had to join the team.\nThe last to join the team was\nHydreigon\n. I think Draco Meteor, paired with Murkrow\u2019s Haze to clear the negative effects, is very powerful. Hydreigon\u2026 I Choose You!\nSo why not using\nGholdengo\n? The move Make It Rain is very powerful and one you can use almost anytime\u2026 But actually, there was no reason. I just like Hydreigon more than Gholdengo!\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nIndeedee\n(F) @ Psychic Seed\nAbility: Psychic Surge\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nPsychic\nEVs: 244 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 4 Spe\nBold Nature\n\u2013 Follow Me\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Helping Hand\n\u2013 Protect\nIndeedee\n\u2018s\nDefense\nis maxed, and\nHP\nis trained to 16\nn\n. The remaining EVs can be allocated to HP, Speed, and Special Attack. Carrying\nPsychic Seed\nplus a great Special Defense can block Hydreigon holding Choice Specs and using Dark Pulse. In general, I think the main bulk is very adequate!\nArmarouge\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Flash Fire\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 228 HP / 20 Def / 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 4 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Expanding Force\n\u2013 Armor Cannon\n\u2013 Trick Room\n\u2013 Protect\nAs one of the attackers, the reason why\nArmarouge\n\u2018s\nSpeed\nEVs are not zero is that my team has both the fast (Tailwind) and the slow (Trick Room) modes. I hoped it to be faster than Jolly Meowscarada in Tailwind.\nThe\nHP\nis adjusted to a value of 189 (which is the greatest value that is 10\nn\n\u22121), with\nLife Orb\nto maximize the benefit of HP loss. Armarouge is currently the only Pok\u00e9mon who can learn\nExpanding Force\nby itself to take advantage of Indeedee\u2019s Psychic Surge-induced Psychic Terrain. The damage is really strong!\nMaushold\n@ Wide Lens\nAbility: Technician\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Population Bomb\n\u2013 Encore\n\u2013 Follow Me\n\u2013 Protect\nMaushold\nis my hero! The move\nPopulation Bomb\nis really strong. Combined with\nWide Lens\nand my belief in Maushold, I can hit 10 times with confidence. There are also support move slots for\nFollow Me\nand\nEncore\n.\nMaushold can also play an excellent supporting role. It acts as a mixed support/offensive piece in my team.\nHydreigon\n@ Choice Specs\nAbility: Levitate\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Draco Meteor\n\u2013 Heat Wave\n\u2013 Dark Pulse\n\u2013 Flash Cannon\nHydreigon\nis the team\u2019s second attacker. The damage of\nChoice Specs\n-boosted moves really makes people like it.\nHydreigon Terastallizes frequently, and its\nSteel\nTera Type can help it resist Fairy- and Dragon-type damage. Use\nDraco Meteor\nalongside Murkrow\u2019s Tailwind, and in the next turn, use Haze to eliminate the negative stat changes and continue to use Draco Meteor to attack mercilessly. The damage of Draco Meteor with Choice Specs is really high, I really like this combination!\nMeowscarada\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Overgrow\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Flower Trick\n\u2013 Knock Off\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Trick Room\nI think both of\nMeowscarada\n\u2018s Abilities,\nOvergrow\nand\nProtean\n, are very strong. The Ability I chose this time is Overgrow with\nFocus Sash\n, which can help the ability to work and then boost\nFlower Trick\nto deal considerable damage.\nIt also has\nTrick Room\n, which is mainly used to counter Pok\u00e9mon who use Tailwind. In the closed team list format we used in\nTainan\n, it could catch the opponent off guard to set up Trick Room, and I then could gain the Speed advantage again.\nMurkrow\n@ Eviolite\nAbility: Prankster\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 140 Def / 108 SpD / 4 Spe\nImpish Nature\n\u2013 Taunt\n\u2013 Haze\n\u2013 Tailwind\n\u2013 Foul Play\nMurkrow\nis excellent for the supporting role. It can use\nTailwind\nto control speed, and also has other excellent status moves, such as\nTaunt\n,\nQuash\n,\nHaze\n\u2026 Haze\u2019s main use is\u00a0to contain the combination of Dondozo and Tatsugiri.\nBasically every player\u2019s team has Murkrow, so I would choose\nTrick Room\nand control the speed. Murkrow would not be used unless facing the combination of Dondozo and Tatsugiri.\nHow to use the team\nLead\nBack\n+\n,\nI like to start with\nMeowscarada\n+\nMaushold\n. These two act as high-speed attackers in my team. When facing a Pok\u00e9mon that uses Tailwind, Maushold can use Protect and Meowscarada can use Trick Room. I save\nArmarouge\nand\nIndeedee\nin the back to attack.\nI almost started every\nTainan\nround like this every game, and it\nhelped me win\nthe tournament!\nTournament run\nUnfortunately, I did not take notes during the tournament so I can\u2019t remember which teams I faced throughout the tournament. This was my run at\nTainan Regionals\n\u2018 top cut!\nTop cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nTop 16\nWin\nMak Kwan\u00a0Ho\n(\nKanadeVgc\n)\nTop 8\nWin\nLin Kun-wu\n(\n\u5047\u9762\u30fb\u5fb7\u30fbC\n)\nTop 4\nWin\nTseng Yi-kai\n(\u8d6b\u863f)\nFinals\nWW\nKu Chao-chen\n(\nFM\u5bf6\u53ef\u5922\u5b50\n)\nYou can watch my\nfinals match\nagainst Chao-chen (starting at 9:00:00) below!\nConclusions\nI am really\nhappy\nand I feel\nlucky\nto win the Championship this time! I could use two of my favourite new Pok\u00e9mon, Maushold and Armarouge, at the same time, and Maushold can attack 10 times per turn.\nI look forward to the next tournaments where I can continue to use\nmy favourite Pok\u00e9mon\nand get good results for me!\nI am very happy to\nshare\nthe information of this competition with you. I hope to have the opportunity to\ncommunicate\nmore with players who love Pok\u00e9mon in the future!

I am\nKu Chao-chen\n, or\nGoogleTWN\nand I\u2019m glad to share the team I used to get to the finals of\nTainan Regionals\nand what I was thinking about the team!\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nI started testing the Ranked Battles for a week before a friend of mine sent me\nthis Rental Team\nby\nJoji Kaieda\n(\nSuica\n).\nIn the testing process, I came to think that\nMurkrow\n,\nGholdengo\nand\nHydreigon\ngave me a good feel, but when I used\nGarchomp\nI lost a lot of games. I felt Garchomp can\u2019t get one-hit knockouts, will be OHKO\u2019d instead very easily, and can\u2019t move faster than the opponent. About\nArcanine\nand\nBreloom\n, I seldom chose them while I was testing this team.\nAfter a few days, I asked my friend\nChen Chih-chun\n(\nToooTz\n) about a new team, and he showed me\nMarkus Stadter\n\u2018s\nStuttgart\n-winning\nRental Team\n, which featured\nAnnihilape\n. How wise of a Pok\u00e9mon choice! I\u2019ll explain better in the next section.\nAfter a lot of thinking, I found my answer to replace Garchomp in\nFederico Camporesi\n\u2018s LimitlessVGC tournament-winning\nRental Team\n:\nDragonite\n!\nFinally, the sixth spot of the team went to\nArmarouge\n, which helped as a counter to Trick Room-oriented Torkoal teams.\nAfter this thought process, I finally had the\nfinal configuration\nof the team!\nThe Team\nGet the original version of the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nGet the latest, improved version of the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nMurkrow\n(F) @ Eviolite\nAbility: Prankster\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 236 HP / 156 Def / 116 SpD\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Foul Play\n\u2013 Tailwind\n\u2013 Haze\n\u2013 Quash\nFrom Suica\u2019s version of the team, I changed\nMurkrow\n\u2018s\nTaunt\nto\nQuash\n, as it was more useful than Taunt most times.\nGholdengo\n@ Choice Specs\nAbility: Good as Gold\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 132 HP / 4 Def / 244 SpA / 4 SpD / 124 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Make It Rain\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Protect\n(originally Trick)\n\u2013 Thunderbolt\nI turned\nGholdengo\nfaster and made it hold\nChoice Specs\n, which dealt much more powerful damage. After the tournament, I changed\nTrick\nto\nProtect\n, because the Choice Specs were frequently Knocked Off. I must remark that\nMake It Rain\nis similarly powerful as Water Spout!\nHydreigon\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Levitate\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Dark Pulse\n\u2013 Flash Cannon\n\u2013 Draco Meteor\n\u2013 Protect\nI only changed\nHydreigon\n\u2018s Tera Type to\nSteel\n.\nAnnihilape\n@ Choice Scarf\nAbility: Defiant\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFighting\nEVs: 252 HP / 92 Atk / 164 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Final Gambit\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Shadow Claw\n\u2013 U-turn\nHow wise of a Pok\u00e9mon choice! When I think that an opposing Pok\u00e9mon is not easy to KO,\nAnnihilape\n\u2018s\nFinal Gambit\ncan be used to turn a 4 vs 4 into a 3 vs 3. When I have the Pok\u00e9mon advantage, it may even turn into a 2 vs 1, which feels like a checkmate.\nI changed one of Annihilape\u2019s moves to\nU-turn\n, since this move can break Focus Sashes and knock out Meowscarada that do not hold it. Murkrow can then switch in to use Tailwind on the following turn, or even attack if you are in a comfortable position.\nBefore\nTainan Regionals\n, my hotel partner\nLiu Jian-ting\n(\nSayha\n)\u00a0told me that, if I ignored\u00a0Dragapult,\u00a0I could invest more EVs in\nAttack\n. Being faster than Kilowattrel with the\nChoice Scarf\nwas enough, although I saw a few Talonflame that day! Investing a little more EVs in\nSpeed\nwould have been better.\nDragonite\n@ Assault Vest\nAbility: Inner Focus\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nNormal\nEVs: 244 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Extreme Speed\n\u2013 Earthquake\n\u2013 Dragon Claw\n\u2013 Brick Break\nSeveral features were important in the choice of\nDragonite\nwith respect to Garchomp:\nWith\nExtreme Speed\n, it can hit faster than Garchomp.\nIt can be trained to be\u00a0stronger than Garchomp, since it does not have the need to invest in\nSpeed\n.\nIt has a similar base\nAttack\nthan Garchomp.\nArmarouge\n(M) @ Covert Cloak\nAbility: Flash Fire\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 21 Spe\n\u2013 Expanding Force\n\u2013 Armor Cannon\n\u2013 Trick Room\n(originally Wide Guard)\n\u2013 Energy Ball\nI lost many games against Torkoal in Trick Room, so I saw the need of a\nTrick Room\ncounter\u2026 Eruption was so powerful! That\u2019s where\nArmarouge\nentered the team.\nI chose to run\nExpanding Force\nwithout a Psychic Terrain setter, since I only sent out Armarouge when I saw a Trick Room team, and the terrain would usually be activated by the opponent.\nHow to use the team\nTip\n: Tailwind is not that important. At first, try to learn about your opponent, and then choose.\nOpponent\u2019s team\nBest leads\nIn the back\nCommon picks, option #1\n+\n,\nCommon picks, option #2\n+\n,\nTalonflame teams\n+\n,\nTrick Room teams\n+\n,\nor\nMurkrow mirror teams, option #1\n+\n,\nor\nMurkrow mirror teams, option #2\n+\nor\n+\n,\nor\nor\n,\nor\nTournament run\nThis was my run at\nTainan Regionals\n!\nSwiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nR1\nWW\nUnknown player\nR2\nWW\nUnknown player\nR3\nLWW\nUnknown player\nR4\nLWW\nUnknown player\nR5\nWW\nLi Yi-ju\n(\n\u5e15\u5e15\u62c9\n)\nR6\nLL\nLiu Jian-ting\n(\nSayha\n)\nTop cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nTop 16\nWLW\nWan Ting-te\n(\n\u842c\u842c\n)\nTop 8\nWLW\nYeh Kuan-cheng\n(\u5168\u5a46\u4fe0)\nTop 4\nLWW\nChen Chih-chun\n(\nToooTz\n)\nFinals\nLL\nTseng Yan-rong\n(Tony)\nYou can watch my\ntop 4 match\nagainst Chih-chun (starting at 8:15:50) and\nfinals match\nagainst Yan-rong (starting at 9:00:00) below!\nConclusions\nHere you have the\nRental Team\nof the version I used in\nTainan\n.
