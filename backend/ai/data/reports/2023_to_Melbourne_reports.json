My name is\nMaheen Thakur\n, and I grew up in\nTokyo\n. I started playing VGC in\n2020\nwith\nPok\u00e9mon Sword\n&\nPok\u00e9mon Shield\nafter being inspired by\nAaron Zheng\n. I only bought my Nintendo Switch during the pandemic, which brought me back to the mainline game after\nPok\u00e9mon Black\n&\nPok\u00e9mon White\n. Since this was my first major online tournament, I am thrilled to share the team that got me in\n10th place at the\nVictory Road to Melbourne\n!\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nThis was the first iteration of the team, and I was experimenting with the new\nRegulation Set B\n. I knew\nIron Hands\nwas insane since it could solo 6\ud83d\udfca Tera Raid Battles with no problem, so I would try to build around this Pok\u00e9mon.\nWhile my best friend\nMatthew\nand I were practicing, we realized that the problem with\nGarganacl\nwas that games often went down to the timer. It was very frustrating to lose, even though the combination of Salt Cure and Recover would have won the game eventually if there had been more time. This brings me to the next iteration of the team:\nAdding\nAmoonguss\nallowed me to complete the Grass + Fire + Water core and add another Fairy-type resistance. Since I already had Iron Hands for Fighting-type coverage, I wanted to try\nRoaring Moon\ninstead of Great Tusk. Replacing Flutter Mane with Curse\nMimikyu\nwas my check for stall-oriented Garganacl and is essential to bring against Dondozo matchups. There was a fun interaction where I could use Curse when Terastallized with Fire Tera Type to outspeed in Trick Room, also increasing Defense and Attack. However, Mimikyu was extremely frail after Disguise was busted, and the results were underwhelming. This brings me to the final version of the team, commonly referred to as\nRoaring Moon balanced\n.\nThe Team\nFind a paste of the team\nhere\n!\nIron Bundle\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Quark Drive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Icy Wind\n\u2013 Freeze-Dry\n\u2013 Hydro Pump\nIron Bundle\nis the only source of speed control on the team with Icy Wind. The EV spread is straightforward, additionally the\nFocus Sash\nallows me to fully invest in Speed and Special Attack.\nFreeze-Dry threatens to one-hit KO Tatsugiri, Pelipper, and Gastrodon.\nThe\nGhost\nTera Type is mainly to make opponents think twice about using Fake Out, and Iron Bundle becomes immune to its Fighting-type weakness. However, it is the least frequently Terastallized member of the team.\nIron Hands\n@ Assault Vest\nAbility: Quark Drive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 4 HP / 156 Atk / 108 Def / 220 SpD / 20 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Wild Charge\n\u2013 Drain Punch\n\u2013 Stomping Tantrum\n\u2013 Fake Out\nIron Hands\nis the main tank for the team, but it also does massive damage. The Special Defense EVs with\nAssault Vest\nallows it to survive a Moonblast from Flutter Mane, which can catch your opponent off-guard. There is a slight Speed investment to outrun an opposing Iron Hands, Kingambit, and min-Speed Armarouge outside Trick Room.\nThe move Stomping Tantrum was added later (replacing Volt Switch) for mirror matchups and against Garganacl with Poison Tera Type, although most Garganacl are running Ghost Tera Type as of recently. Volt Switch is still a viable option. The most notable weakness is Will-O-Wisp, halving its damage output from burns, but switching in Arcanine or Gholdengo can save Iron Hands from the status condition.\nThe\nGrass\nTera Type helps Iron Hands against Great Tusk, because Headlong Rush is a guaranteed one-hit KO.\nDefensive calcs\n252+ SpA\nFairy Tera Type\nFlutter Mane\nMoonblast\nvs. 4 HP / 220 SpD Assault Vest Iron Hands: 172-204 (74.7 \u2013 88.6%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252+ SpA\nLife Orb\nArmarouge\nExpanding Force\nvs. 4 HP / 220 SpD Assault Vest Iron Hands in\nPsychic Terrain\n: 148-174 (64.3 \u2013 75.6%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n4 SpA Gothitelle\nPsychic\nvs. 4 HP / 220 SpD Assault Vest Iron Hands: 68-84 (29.5 \u2013 36.5%) \u2014 44.1% chance to 3HKO\nRoaring Moon\n@ Booster Energy\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFlying\nEVs: 156 Atk / 100 Def / 252 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Throat Chop\n\u2013 Taunt\n\u2013 Acrobatics\nRoaring Moon\nis the main damage dealer for the team. I hesitated to go with Jolly Nature because I wanted to slightly invest in Defense to survive unexpected hits. Furthermore, an Attack-raising\nBooster Energy\ncan\none-hit KO Indeedee and Armarouge. I valued this over the extra boost in Speed since Indeedee paired with Armarouge is such a common archetype in the current metagame.\nThroat Chop prevents the use of Hyper Voice from common threats like Sylveon (although the opponent might choose to use Tera Blast). Having Taunt on Roaring Moon can save itself and allies from unwanted status moves. Booster Energy Acrobatics kinda goes hard, not gonna lie!\nOffensive calcs\n156+ Atk\nFlying Tera Type\nRoaring Moon\nAcrobatics\n(110 BP) vs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Amoonguss: 316-376 (142.9 \u2013 170.1%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n156+ Atk Roaring Moon\nThroat Chop\nvs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Indeedee-F: 182-216 (102.8 \u2013 122%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n156+ Atk Roaring Moon\nThroat Chop\nvs. 252 HP / 4 Def Armarouge: 192-228 (100 \u2013 118.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n156+ Atk Iron Hands\nDrain Punch\nvs. 0 HP / 100 Def Roaring Moon: 162-192 (90 \u2013 106.6%) \u2014 43.8% chance to OHKO\nAmoonguss\n@ Covert Cloak\nAbility: Regenerator\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 236 HP / 196 Def / 76 SpD\nSassy Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Spore\n\u2013 Rage Powder\n\u2013 Pollen Puff\n\u2013 Clear Smog\nAmoonguss\nprovides redirection and overall disruption for the opponent. The 236 HP EVs is crucial for Amoonguss as it can survive a Final Gambit from Annihilape. The HP stat is divisible by 3, which is optimal for Regenerator recovery.\nCovert Cloak\nas a held item is very helpful with Garganacl matchups, it also prevents flinches and the Frozen status after Freeze-Dry.\nThe\nDark\nTera Type is mainly for Psychic immunity against Trick Room matchups.\nDefensive calcs\n252 SpA Iron Bundle\nFreeze-Dry\nvs. 236 HP / 76+ SpD Amoonguss: 116-138 (52.9 \u2013 63%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252+ SpA\nChoice Specs\nGholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs. 236 HP / 76+ SpD Amoonguss: 127-150 (57.9 \u2013 68.4%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 Atk Arcanine\nFlare Blitz\nvs. 236 HP / 196 Def Amoonguss: 192-228 (87.6 \u2013 104.1%) \u2014 18.8% chance to OHKO\nArcanine\n@ Safety Goggles\nAbility: Intimidate\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 204 HP / 4 Atk / 108 Def / 188 SpD / 4 Spe\nCareful Nature\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Flare Blitz\n\u2013 Will-O-Wisp\n\u2013 Snarl\nArcanine\nis the primary source of damage reduction for the team. The moveset is standard. However, I wanted extra bulk to survive a Hydro Pump from Iron Bundle and even a Headlong Rush from Great Tusk after Intimidate.\nCloverBells\nhelped me come up with the EV spread for Arcanine to achieve this goal.\nI chose\nWater\nTera Type over Grass because it already has Safety Goggles. My\nWater-Tera Type Arcanine can still resist Flare Blitz from other Arcanine and Make It Rain from Gholdengo, which a Grass-Tera Type Arcanine cannot otherwise provide.\nDefensive calcs\n252 SpA Iron Bundle\nHydro Pump\nvs. 204 HP / 188+ SpD Arcanine: 162-192 (84.8 \u2013 100.5%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\n-1\n252+ Atk Great Tusk\nHeadlong Rush\nvs. 204 HP / 108 Def Arcanine: 162-192 (84.8 \u2013 100.5%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\nGholdengo\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Good as Gold\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 132 HP / 4 Def / 116 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Make It Rain\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Nasty Plot\nGholdengo\nis the secondary damage dealer that also has excellent synergy with Roaring Moon, covering for each other\u2019s weaknesses. Although I was leaning towards a bulkier spread, I felt the need for Timid max Speed to speed tie with other Gholdengo. As a compromise, I invested more in HP by reaching the second 10\nn\n\u22121 for\nLife Orb\nrecoil optimization.\nNasty Plot allows it to compensate for the reduced Special Attack, and the defensive\nWater\nTera Type has been great against opposing Fire types.\nOffensive calcs\n116 SpA Life Orb Gholdengo\nShadow Ball\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Armarouge: 198-234 (103.1 \u2013 121.8%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n116 SpA Life Orb Gholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs. 4 HP / 4 SpD Flutter Mane: 140-166 (106.8 \u2013 126.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n116 SpA Life Orb Gholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs. 4 HP / 4 SpD Iron Bundle: 136-161 (103 \u2013 121.9%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nHow to use the team\nThe best thing about this team is the flexibility to lead any 2 Pok\u00e9mon in all combinations. Playing in this tournament and the Regulation Set B ladder, I have come up with preferable leads against common matchups.\nOpponent\u2019s team\nComments\nTrick Room teams\nLeading with\nRoaring Moon + Gholdengo\nimmediately exerts a lot of pressure on the opponent. Roaring Moon can Throat Chop Indeedee for the guaranteed one-hit KO. A Shadow Ball from Gholdengo will also one-hit KO Armarouge without heavy Special Defense investment. This will force out an early Terastallization from the opponent or require them to switch out. Having\nArcanine\nor\nAmoonguss\nin the back for support is ideal if the opponent makes some switches or chooses to Terastallize, just in case you cannot deny Trick Room.\nAcid Spray teams\nUsually, you can lead with\nIron Bundle + Roaring Moon\nto scout out the move Flutter Mane with Choice Specs locks into. Since Iron Bundle has a Focus Sash, you can take a hit from the Speed-boosted Iron Moth and use Icy Wind. It is up to Roaring Moon to decide which opponent to target, as both Iron Moth and Flutter Mane have very low Defense stats. Replacing\nGholdengo\nfor Roaring Moon is also a valid option. However, Gholdengo may require an early Water-type Terastallization.\nGarganacl balanced teams\nAmoonguss\nwith Covert Cloak is the MVP for this sort of matchup. The key game plan is to preserve Amoonguss from its common threats and redirect Salt Cure from Garganacl. Then, if Amoonguss is low on HP, you can switch out for Regenerator recovery and heal up the team with Pollen Puff. Inevitably, many switches and repositioning are required, but slow and steady wins the race.\nThis really\ndepends on the Tatsugiri form\nthat Dondozo is paired with.\nArcanine\nor\nAmoonguss\nis essential to bring in the back for this matchup. Speed-boosting Dondozo (paired with Stretchy Tatsugiri) is easier to manage with Intimidate cycling with Arcanine. Problems arise when an Attack-boosting Dondozo (paired with Curly Tatsugiri) has the Steel Tera Type or knows Substitute, since you cannot simply Clear Smog or Spore it with Amoonguss. The general game plan is for\nIron Hands\nor\nRoaring Moon\nto deal consistent damage and break the Substitute while cycling in Intimidate with Arcanine and possibly even burning it.\nIron Bundle\ncan manage Tatsugiri (and also damage Dondozo) once it leaves the Commander status. On the other hand, Amoonguss can heal up the team throughout the battle.\nWolfe Glick\n\u2018s\nPerish Trap team\nThis is an unfavorable matchup, and even one misplay can significantly change the tides of the game. When considering Gothitelle\u2019s Ability, Shadow Tag, leading with\nIron Bundle + Gholdengo\nis the safest option. Since Gholdengo is immune to Perish Song, the opponent has to target down Gholdengo for their win condition, which is why Iron Bundle can check common threats such as Arcanine. The Ghost Tera Type on Iron Bundle also allows it to pivot out from Shadow Tag and bypass Fake Out. Water-Tera Type Terastallization on Gholdengo is also an option when needed, but it now loses its ability to switch out.\nRoaring Moon\ncan outspeed Perish Song users and Throat Chop once their Speed is lowered from Icy Wind. However, the 4\u00d7 Fairy-type weakness is a considerable risk without Flying Tera Type. Considering this fact,\nAmoonguss\nor\nArcanine\nmight be a safer option.\nIron Hands\ncan deal with Gothitelle late game as Psychic has a chance to 3-hit KO full-HP Iron Hands despite being super effective, barring any critical hits.\nTournament run\nThis was\nmy first major tournament\n, and having 8 Swiss rounds of best-of-3 matches was really challenging, especially since it started from 11 pm in my timezone. I considered dropping out around 3 am, but my friend Matthew insisted that I keep going. I was pleasantly surprised with the results.\nWith that being said, this was my run for\nVictory Road to Melbourne\n:\nSwiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nMarco Silva\n(\nmarcofiero\n)\nR2\nLWL\nFrancesco Raga\n(\nLil Darkrai\n)\nR3\nWW\nMarco Cucini\n(\nPietro\n)\nR4\nWW\nTakahiro Ishida\n(\n\u30cb\u30ac\u30fb\u30ca\u30aa\u30df\n)\nR5\nLWW\nMichel Boldewijn\n(\nSteambot\n)\nR6\nLWW\nAndrea Cassinese\n(\nAndrea\n)\nR7\nWW\nJuan Borreguero\n(\nMithos\n)\nR8\nLL\nAapo Niemiranta\n(\nAapo\n)\nTop cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 32\nLWW\nJuan Borreguero\n(\nMithos\n)\nTop 16\nLL\nAapo Niemiranta\n(\nAapo\n)\nNotes\nTop 32\nTop 16\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my top cut matches!\nTop 32\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 32\nLWW\nJuan Borreguero\n(\nMithos\n)\nAnnihilape was the main damage dealer for Juan.

Denying Will-O-Wisp from Heat Rotom with Taunt was very helpful. Predicting the switch allowed me to hit Heat Rotom with Hydro Pump (luckily, it did not miss) super effectively.\nTop 16\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 16\nLL\nAapo Niemiranta\n(\nAapo\n)\nI ran into\nGarganacl with Curse\n, which, funnily enough (I had Mimikyu with Curse before to counter Garganacl) I was totally unprepared for.
