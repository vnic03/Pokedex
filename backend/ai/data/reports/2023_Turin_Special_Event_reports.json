I\u2019m\nAlessio Fusc\u00e0\n, aka\nNikyuAlex\nonline, and I\u2019m from Rome, Italy. I have been playing VGC in events since mid\n2017\nin my city and before the\nTurin Special Event\n. Despite having a bunch of very good results online, I always struggled to get any important results in official major tournaments.\nMy background is in fact almost completely based on online tournaments, with very few exceptions such as the\ntop 32 at\n2020 Bochum Regionals\nand 3 top 64 at\n2019 EUIC\nin Berlin, at the\n2020 DC Open\nand at the\n2022 Milan Special Event\nin Assago. I also\nqualified twice for Worlds\n, in 2019 and in 2022, but both times with a very bad run. Even going very well in local tournaments, at the end of the day I always came out short in major ones.\nWhat\u2019s changed this time? In Pok\u00e9mon VGC the most important thing it\u2019s a mix between a good preparation before an event and a consistent run during it, but everything starts from a very good team. The so-called \u201ccall\u201d or \u201c\nmeta call\n\u201d, having the right team at the right moment, gives you a boost even before the start of the tournament, and basically I almost always had the wrong team in major tournaments. In this report I\u2019d like to explain to you why my team was a great call for the Turin Special Event and why, this time,\nit worked so well\n.\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nThe\nTurin Special Event\nturned out to be a record-setting tournament in players attendance very quickly (speaking at least of Italian VGC events), with\nalmost 600 players\nin the Master Division for the VGC. A lot of players means a lot of teams, and a lot of teams means that you have to be prepared for two things: probably you are going to face a lot of different teams; and the tournament will be very long and stressful. In these situations you need a team with\nmultiple tools\nand, most importantly,\nmultiple modes\n.\nYou of course want to take the situation easy, because, even though you have the open team list of your opponent, you don\u2019t know a lot of things\u2014you don\u2019t know if certain Pok\u00e9mon could outspeed yours, or if you are going to outspeed them instead. At the same time you don\u2019t want to finish the rounds too tired, and in that case you need instant damage in order to change the pace of the game very quickly. I needed my team to be\nmixed and balanced\n, being able to go\nvery fast\nand offensive\nbut also\nslow and controlled\n, even during the same game. I didn\u2019t have any team able to do so until two friends of mine,\nDario Cozzo\nand\nAlessandro Lai\n, gave it to me. A team with a long story behind it that I will summarize phase by phase.\nThis team was born in March when the\nRegulation Set C\nwas revealed. The first concept was a core of\nDragapult + Chien-Pao\u00a0+ Ting-Lu\n, with the first two being the main lead and Ting-Lu as a consistent Pok\u00e9mon able to support them, thanks to its Vessel of Ruin Ability. The main lead provides instant physical firepower with\nChoice Band\nDragapult and\nIce-Tera Type\nChien-Pao, which had\nIcicle Crash\ninstead of Ice Spinner to deal extra damage. Another cool pick on Chien-Pao was\nIce Shard\n, different from Sucker Punch because you don\u2019t need the target to attack you with an offensive move in order to use it, and being Chien-Pao faster than Talonflame you also have a useful tool to break Gale Wings from the start.\nThe team needed some special damage, being the main core built with only physical Pok\u00e9mon, and that\u2019s why\nGholdengo\nentered the team. It\u2019s a very good Pok\u00e9mon to deal with the Arcanine + Amoonguss duo, thanks to its\nWater Tera Type\n, and it\u2019s also good against the stall strategies thanks to the combination of Leftovers and Nasty Plot.\nAfter a first phase with\nFlutter Mane\nas fifth slot, in order to have even more firepower in terms of special moves, the final pick in that slot was\nAmoonguss\n. It has a very good synergy with both Gholdengo and Ting-Lu, being able to heal them with Pollen Puff and redirecting threatening moves with Rage Powder. If the opponent\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon are not very offensive or simply not very effective against them, Amoonguss + Gholdengo can easily dominate the situation. My version of Amoonguss has\nClear Smog\n, while Dario and Alessandro picked Protect instead. Probably there is not an undisputed truth for the fourth move of Amoonguss here, so feel free to pick what you prefer but, a little piece of advice:\u00a0be very careful against Dondozo and other set-ups if you decide to play Protect.\nHere comes the star of the team! The sixth slot is the one that had more changes since March. It first was\nPalafin\n(in multiple versions), then it became\nGyarados\nafter that I suggested it to Dario and Alessandro and the team improved. 1 or 2 weeks before Turin, though, they realized that Kingambit and Annihilape were becoming very popular, and the team struggled a lot against them. Looking at\nMalm\u00f6\n\u2018s top cut they realized that the\nPaldean Tauros Blaze Breed\nin\nMaurice Uteg\n\u2018s\nTop 4 team\nprobably was a very good replacement for Gyarados, but after a little bit of testing they decided to turn it into the\nAqua Breed\none. Despite gaining a weakness against Flutter Mane, the Aqua Breed was much better against Fire-Tera Type Kingambit, it was much better against Fire-Tera Type Annihilape and most importantly it has a priority move in Aqua Jet. As I said during the interview after the top 8, I got more KOs with Aqua Jet than with Wave Crash or Close Combat during the Special Event. Tauros basically turned a pretty decent team into a tremendously good one, it has been\nthe real MVP\nof my run.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nDragapult\n@\nChoice Band\nAbility: Clear Body\nLevel: 50\nShiny: Yes\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 28 HP / 204 Atk / 12 Def / 44 SpD / 220 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Dragon Darts\n\u2013 Outrage\n\u2013 Phantom Force\n\u2013 Tera Blast\nDragapult\nhas had\u00a0Dragon Tera Type for almost all the time, with U-turn over Tera Blast, but two weeks before Turin it became\nFire Tera Type with Tera Blast\ninstead. We wanted more coverage with our Dragapult but we didn\u2019t like the Steel Tera Type, as it makes Dragapult always weak to the\u00a0Chi-Yu + Flutter Mane lead (which is also very good in order to prevent our\u00a0Gholdengo\u00a0+\u00a0Amoonguss). Having the Fire Tera Type opened the chance to lead\nTing Lu + Dragapult\nin front of them and going for\nDragon Darts\n+\nHeavy Slam\non Flutter Mane. The opponent can only deal damage with one of them, because, if Chi-Yu and Flutter Mane both stay on the field, Chi-Yu almost always goes KO (and if not, you can adapt in G2 and G3). Dragapult + Ting-Lu with this new Tera Type became a\nvery successful lead\nthat I suggested to Dario and Alessandro as soon as I understood how strong it was\nTera Blast also can take the guaranteed KO on Flutter Mane even with bulky spreads.\nOffensive calcs\n204 Atk Choice Band Sword of Ruin\nTera-Fire\nDragapult\nTera Blast\nvs. 228 HP / 140 Def Flutter Mane: 160-190 (100.6 \u2013 119.4%) \u2014\nguaranteed OHKO\nChien-Pao\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Sword of Ruin\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nIce\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Icicle Crash\n\u2013 Ice Shard\n\u2013 Sacred Sword\n\u2013 Protect\nAs said,\nChien-Pao\nis classic except for the 2 STAB moves:\nIcicle Crash\nand\nIce Shard\ninstead of Ice Spinner and Sucker Punch. We talked about the reasons behind Ice Shard previously, but we didn\u2019t do the same for Icicle Crash yet, and believe me if I say that it made the difference.\nIn this metagame most of the times the defensive calcs are borderline, you hang on after certain moves but with few HP remaining. Icicle Crash provides a little\nextra damage\nbut it\u2019s enough to break the calcs and to even get unexpected KOs with the right roll. Another important thing is that Icicle Crash doesn\u2019t trigger items like Rocky Helmet or the damage of Spiky Shield, because\nit is not a contact move\n, and of course it can flinch. It can also miss, it happened a couple of times, but I never lost a best-of-3 due to it missing. The reward of running Icicle Crash is 100% worth the risk. I was tempted to put Ice Spinner until the very last minute, but at the end of the day I\u2019m glad that I kept Icicle Crash.\nTing-Lu\n@ Assault Vest\nAbility: Vessel of Ruin\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 68 HP / 156 Atk / 12 Def / 220 SpD / 52 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Stomping Tantrum\n\u2013 Heavy Slam\n\u2013 Sand Tomb\n\u2013 Ruination\nOk funny story here:\nTing-Lu\nwas\nNOT supposed to be like this\n. For some reason\nRK9\u2019s Team List Creator\ndidn\u2019t save the changes on the moveset and on the Tera Type, which is bad as I had intended for\nFairy Tera Type\nand\nStone Edge\nover Sand Tomb. Since it was my first major with the new OTS (open teamsheet) system, due to two consecutive surgeries that I had since the beginning of the year, I didn\u2019t even know that I was allowed to ask for a last-minute fix on the team list before the start, so I just put the old Ting-Lu on the Battle Box and started to play with it. Not gonna lie, I won a couple of matches thanks to this version, but in top 4, for example, I had more chances against\nSimone Sanvito\nwith the right version.\nWhatever, it worked anyway and it worked very well, so I guess that\nboth versions are good\n, it simply depends on the context. As said for the versions of Amoonguss previously, try both of them and then decide which one is your favorite, but in this case I\u2019d suggest you the one with\nFairy Tera Type\n.\nGholdengo\n@ Leftovers\nAbility: Good as Gold\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 244 HP / 36 Def / 20 SpA / 4 SpD / 204 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Make It Rain\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Nasty Plot\n\u2013 Thunderbolt\nI\u2019m very proud of this\nGholdengo\nbecause we discussed a lot about it during the testing calls. Dario and Alessandro wanted to play Turin with Shadow Ball over Thunderbolt, but I constantly kept telling them that\nThunderbolt was too important\n. It was perfect for Corviknight, which was becoming very popular, and against bulky Water types as well (or against bulky Pok\u00e9mon with the Water Tera Type).\nIt absolutely paid off and we never missed Shadow Ball even for a single minute. The spread is very unique because it\u2019s both bulky and fast, and even while losing some firepower without\nNasty Plot\nit turned out to be perfect in a lot of situations. It also happened to be faster than some versions of Chi-Yu, as it happened in my featured match against\nAdam Cherfaoui\n. This version of Gholdengo is the best that I played so far and I\u2019m so happy about the performance that it gave.\nThe amount of HP is not optimized for the Leftovers, but Dario and Alessandro said that\nit helps optimize a lot of rolls\n, and to be honest I felt it during the matches, so I guess they are right.\nAmoonguss\n(M) @ Sitrus Berry\nAbility: Regenerator\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 244 HP / 156 Def / 4 SpA / 100 SpD / 4 Spe\nBold Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Pollen Puff\n\u2013 Rage Powder\n\u2013 Spore\n\u2013 Clear Smog\nFor this wonderful Pok\u00e9mon a \u201c\nlong live Amoonguss\n\u201d should be enough as description, it\u2019s simply one of the strongest Pok\u00e9mon ever. It was strong before the 8th generation, and now with\nPollen Puff\nit\u2019s even stronger, probably more in\nScarlet\n&\nViolet\nthan in\nSword\n&\nShield\n. Basically without any Max Airstream or 130/140 base power super effective moves its durability is higher and it can provide a very important help to its partners.\nAs I mentioned, I prefer Amoonguss without Protect\u00a0because you don\u2019t want to be passive with it, you have to be dangerous or annoying by healing your main damage dealer or by putting to sleep the opponent\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon if possible. This team would\nnever\nbe the same without Amoonguss, and with this spread it can\nhang on very well\nversus almost everything, from neutral Arcanine\u2019s\u00a0Flare Blitz\u00a0to the combination of Freeze-Dry + Shadow Ball of Iron Bundle + Flutter Mane thanks to the recovery of the\nSitrus Berry\n.\nTauros-Paldea-Aqua\n@ Mirror Herb\nAbility: Intimidate\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 116 HP / 116 Atk / 28 Def / 68 SpD / 180 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Wave Crash\n\u2013 Aqua Jet\n\u2013 Protect\nOk now it\u2019s the turn of the true MVP.\nPaldean Tauros Aqua Breed\nis the hottest pick of the team and it basically\nsolved every problem\nof it, starting from the very bad match-up against Kingambit. It is also very good against Maushold + Annihilape when the Annihilape is Fire Tera Type, and of course is great against Dondozo, especially when it\u2019s Oblivious, because if you copy the boost you can have a fair 1v1 situation against it, considering that you can easily heal yourself with Amoonguss.\nOf course the optimal scenario is getting the boost and then using\nClear Smog\non Dondozo, and if Dondozo has the Steel Tera Type you can rely on +2 Close Combat. Against the Unaware version,\nIntimidate\nworks, so of course it\u2019s a much easier situation to manage.\nFun fact that I didn\u2019t know before: if your opponent uses Howl, Tauros doesn\u2019t get a +1, it gets a\n+2\ninstead because it\ncopies all the boosts of the same turn at once\nand that\u2019s great against Palafin balance teams. Being Howl the main tool of Arcanine in order to equalize a drop from Intimidate, and being Tauros a very good Intimidate user against Palafin balance teams, the match-up will almost always be in your favor\u2014although it\u2019s not an auto-win situation.\nHow to use the team\nVS\n\"Palance\" with Roaring Moon\n\"Palance\" with Baxcalibur\nHyper offense with Kingambit\nSpanish or new balance\nDondozo control\nVS\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about the strongest leads and Pok\u00e9mon in the back!\n\"Palance\" with Roaring Moon\nLead\nGholdengo + Chien-Pao\nHave Tauros and Amoonguss in the back\n\"Palance\" with Baxcalibur\nLead\nDragapult + Chien-Pao\nHave Gholdengo and Tauros in the back\nHyper offense with Kingambit\nThis is the team\nMarco Silva\nused to finish second at\nMalm\u00f6 Regional\n.\nLead\nTauros + Ting-Lu\nor\nTauros + Amoonguss\n, depending on the team\u2019s version\nHave Chien-Pao and Amoonguss or Ting-Lu in the back\nSpanish or new balance\nThis is the team\nEric Rios\nhas been using or the one with which\nSimone Sanvito\nfinished second in\nTurin\n.\nLead\nDragapult + Ting-Lu\nHave Gholdengo and either Amoonguss or Tauros in the back\nDondozo control\nLead\nTauros + Ting-Lu\nHave Amoonguss + Chien-Pao in the back\nOnly if the opponent has the Dragonite + Chien-Pao version of the team, lead\nGholdengo + Amoonguss\nTournament run\nThis was my run at the\nTurin Special Event\n!\nDay 1 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWin\nAntoine Guyader\n(\nDarkGold\n)\nR2\nWin\nFederico Scremin\n(Mendon\u00e7a)\nR3\nWin\nMattia Angelini\n(\nMatty\n)\nR4\nWin\nNathan Rouby\n(Eltrys)\nR5\nWin\nAdam Cherfaoui\n(\nShao\n)\nR6\nLoss\nChristian De\u00a0Nicolo\n(\nDot1Q\n)\nR7\nWin\nNicol\u00f2 Venturin\n(Chad)\nR8\nWin\nJack Clarke\n(\nJack\n)\nR9\nWin\nNicholas Belometti\n(\nJoy Boy\n)\nYou can watch my\nSwiss round 5 match\nversus Adam below!:\nDay 2 Swiss Rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nWin\nEnrico Genovese\n(\nEnrijai\n)\nR11\nLoss\nAdam Cherfaoui\n(\nShao\n)\nR12\nWin\nFrancesco\u00a0P.

I missed so much playing in major tournaments, the time at home recovering from the surgeries that I had has been very hard, I really suffered seeing my friends going to tournaments without me being there and having fun with them during the season.\nThis\nTop 4\nis a perfect ending. Not gonna lie, it would be better winning of course, but I cannot pretend to be stronger than\nNico Davide Cognetta\n(\nDesu\n) and\nSimone Sanvito\n(\u2606\nSanvy\n), also considering all the time I spent without being active. They legit earned their spot in the finals and I am happy for them!\nI want to say thank you again to\nDario Cozzo\n(\nJDart\n),\nAlessandro Lai\n(\nLTMS\n) and all their testing crew,\nIl Circo\n, for giving me the idea of using their team. It\u2019s not an easy team, and even though you prepare a lot of game plans of course you don\u2019t play against bots; at the highest scores you are against the best of the best and you need to adapt because you can bet on them doing the same against you. This team is strong because it gives you the right tools to adapt when plans and pace change, making you able to go aggressive from the start or stalling the opponent by constantly healing your Pok\u00e9mon and putting the opponents to sleep. You should see it as a\nbig and good toolbox\n, and finding the right tools at the right moment is\nup to you\n.\nI\u2019d also like to do some shout outs, first to my best friends\nSilvia\nand\nGilberto Goracci\nand to my teammates of\nCapital Underdogs\n, then of course to all my other friends that supported me and cheered from round 1 until the very last turn against Sanvy.\nThanks again to\nFrancesco Pardini\n,\nFrancesco Cilurzo\n(\nCydonia\n),\nChiara Rocco\nand all of their staff because it is thanks to them that in 2016 I decided to play Pok\u00e9mon once again (after 4 years) and even started to play VGC in official tournaments in 2017, but if I kept playing after a tough start it is also thanks to my first testing group (who I can now call brothers) named \u201c\nDragon Absinthe\n\u201d, so thank you all guys because you all made me (directly and indirectly) the player and the man that I am today. And I wanted to say \u201cman\u201d as well because 6 years ago I was not the kind of guy who claps to the opponent after a loss as I did to Sanvy,\nthis journey definitely improved me as a human being\nas well.\nLast shoutout to\nthe staff of\nVGC Guide\n, for including me in the team as translator for the Italian version of their wiki, and to my buddies of the\nLuminescent Team\nbehind the mod Pok\u00e9mon Luminescent Version!\nThank you all\nand see you soon, hopefully with more than a Top 4 next time!\nYou might also like...\nStream details and caster lineup for Bologna Special Event have been announced!\nThe last event of the season in Europe is streamed on 1\u20132 June, with Charlie Merriman, Jamie Boyt, Lee Provost and Markus Stadter as casters.\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez\n28 May, 2024\nDavid Rodr\u00edguez is the 2024 Mexico City Special Event Champion!\n2024 LAIC semifinalist David Rodr\u00edguez has won his fourth Special Event title!
