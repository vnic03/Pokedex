My name is\nAaron Brok\nand I started playing VGC in\n2020\nwith\nPok\u00e9mon Sword\nand\nPok\u00e9mon Shield\n. This was my second in-person event, the first being the\nNorth American International Championship\nin 2022. With that out of the way, I\u2019m happy to share the team I used to get\ntop 4 in the\nSan Diego Regional Championship\n!\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nAs I was trying different things out shortly after\nSeries 1\nwas announced, I started to think of a way to use\nPalafin\nsince I thought it could be very strong if utilized correctly (and it has a super cool design). I saw the\nteam\nthat\nRen Chengfu\nused in the\nVR Welcome to Paldea\ntournament and decided to try it out.\nI didn\u2019t like the double rain sweeper strategy, so I changed Barraskewda to\nHariyama\nwhich can help set up Trick Room easier with Fake Out.\nI brought the team to a local where I finished top 4, and I was completely sold on most of the team, especially\nPelipper\nand\nKingambit\n. However, Palafin felt very difficult to bring and I realized I was not going to be the one to figure out this Pok\u00e9mon.\nThis is when my friend\nDarcy McCarthy\nsuggested I try\nDrednaw\ninstead. Drednaw gave me speed and coverage that Palafin or other Swift Swim Pok\u00e9mon didn\u2019t have. Rock Slide hits both of the priority Tailwind users, Talonflame and Murkrow, as well as Donzozo with the Flying Tera Type and Dragonite (before Terastallizing).\nAfter slightly tweaking some sets, I had the final version of the team!\nThe Team\nFind a paste of the team\nhere\n!\nPo\n(Hariyama) @ Flame Orb\nAbility: Guts\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nSteel\nEVs: 156 HP / 156 Atk / 196 SpD\nBrave Nature\nIVs: 0 Spe\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Fake Out\n\u2013 Knock Off\n\u2013 Bullet Punch\nHariyama\nwas definitely the weakest link, but was still a very scary Trick Room attacker when positioned well. I chose a Steel Tera Type to gain resistances to all of Hariyama\u2019s original weaknesses and to give STAB (same-type attack bonus) to Bullet Punch. Its Attack reaches a jump point, its HP is 16\nn\n\u22121 to minimize burn damage, and the rest was just dumped into Special Defense.\nMr Ping\n(Farigiraf) @ Safety Goggles\nAbility: Armor Tail\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 212 HP / 180 Def / 76 SpA / 36 SpD\nQuiet Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Psychic\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Trick Room\n\u2013 Helping Hand\nThere is a ton of priority in this format, so\nFarigiraf\nwas great on paper and in testing. It was slightly worse during the actual tournament, but still solid. I chose the Safety Goggles item because the team had a bit of trouble with opposing Amoonguss. Fairy Tera Type gives STAB to Dazzling Gleam which helps against opposing Dragon and Dark types, while also negating the original Dark-type weakness.\nHelping Hand could help secure KOs in theory, but did not come up very often during the tournament. It has enough HP to survive Annihilape\u2019s Final Gambit, and always survives any Make it Rain except those from Modest Choice Specs that have Terastallized to Steel (Timid is not guaranteed but has a roll in my favor to live). It also survives Kowtow Cleave from Kingambit with no kinds of boosts.\nKai\n(Kingambit) @ Assault Vest\nAbility: Defiant\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFlying\nEVs: 252 HP / 196 Atk / 4 Def / 20 SpD / 36 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Kowtow Cleave\n\u2013 Iron Head\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Brick Break\nKingambit\nis easily the MVP of the team. With the Assault Vest, this thing becomes a monster to remove while dealing incredible damage with its high base Attack. I chose Flying Tera Type to turn all of Kingambit\u2019s previous weaknesses into resistances (with rain). Brick Break was chosen as more consistent damage compared to Low Kick, while also breaking screens, although I only ended up facing one Grimmsnarl and no Sableye\u00a0 during the whole tournament. It outspeeds Gholdengo under Tailwind, but still underspeeds base 60s with 31 Speed IVs for Trick Room.\nTigress\n(Meowscarada) @ Focus Sash\nAbility: Overgrow\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Flower Trick\n\u2013 Knock Off\n\u2013 U-turn\nMeowscarada\nis Rillaboom and Urshifu at home. Guaranteed crit move, removing items, and pivoting, this Pok\u00e9mon is just super solid overall. Pretty standard set, Focus Sash allowing it to take one hit guaranteed, which pairs well with Overgrow.\nLord Shen\n(Pelipper) @ Sitrus Berry\nAbility: Drizzle\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 244 HP / 4 Def / 36 SpA / 124 SpD / 100 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Hurricane\n\u2013 Tailwind\n\u2013 Wide Guard\n\u2013 Hydro Pump\nI think\nPelipper\nsurprised a lot of people with its overall performance at this Regional. It has a ton of good utility in Tailwind and Wide Guard and does surprisingly good damage with its good types and high base power STAB moves. Grass Tera Type allowed me to gain a resistance to Electric and also avoid powder moves, also helping against Amoonguss. It outspeeds Talonflame under Tailwind.\nDefensive calcs\n252+ SpA\nChoice Specs\nGholdengo\nShadow Ball\nvs. 244 HP / 124 SpD Tera-Grass Pelipper: 129-153 (77.7 \u2013 92.1%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO after Sitrus Berry recovery\n252 Atk Meowscarada\nFlower Trick\nvs. 244 HP / 4 Def Pelipper on a critical hit: 81-96 (48.7 \u2013 57.8%) \u2014 14.5% chance to 2HKO after Sitrus Berry recovery\n+2\n252+ Atk Dondozo\nWave Crash\nvs. 244 HP / 4 Def Pelipper in Rain: 140-165 (84.3 \u2013 99.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO after Sitrus Berry recovery\n252 Atk\nTechnician\nMaushold\nPopulation Bomb\n(10 hits) vs. 244 HP / 4 Def Pelipper: 180-220 (108.4 \u2013 132.5%) \u2014 approx. 12.5% chance to OHKO\nOogway\n(Drednaw) @ Life Orb\nAbility: Swift Swim\nLevel: 50\nShiny: Yes\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 28 HP / 252 Atk / 228 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Liquidation\n\u2013 Rock Slide\n\u2013 Tera Blast\nDrednaw\nis the wild card. This thing was so fun to use. I chose an Adamant Nature because I wanted it to do as much damage as possible and didn\u2019t think I needed Jolly to outspeed anything important in rain. Its HP is 10\nn\n\u22121 for Life Orb recoil, but in all honesty it could just as well have been max speed. In rain, it outspeeds anything slower than base 97 at +1 or holding a Choice Scarf. I chose Grass Tera Type to combat its Grass-, Electric-, and Ground-type weaknesses and to avoid Amoonguss, and gave it Tera Blast to hit opposing Water types harder.\nHow to use the team\nThis team is very\nflexible\nand allows the player to react to opponents\u2019 decisions and play accordingly. Meowscarada is very commonly brought and led, and can be led with essentially any of the other 5 Pok\u00e9mon.\nMeowscarada + Farigiraf\ncan mimic Urshifu + Tsareena from Gen 8 with the critical hit move, priority blocking, and Helping Hand support. Pelipper often is brought without Drednaw and can be led or brought in the back.\nOpponent\u2019s team\nGameplan\nThe priority is Knocking Off Dondozo\u2019s item and preserving resources, then just constantly damaging it, with Pelipper providing speed control to keep up with the Commander and Order Up boosts. Your main source of damage is dependent on Dondozo\u2019s Tera Type: if the Dondozo has\nDragon\nTera Type, Farigiraf is basically mandatory to have something to hit it for super effective. Hariyama becomes an option to help set up Trick Room. For\nFlying\nTera Type Dondozo, you want to utilize Drednaw and take advantage of Rock Slide becoming super effective. Be aware that +2 Wave Crash in Rain has a decent chance to one-hit KO Drednaw after the Life Orb recoil, even after Terastallizing to Grass!\nGrass\nTera Type Dondozo opens it up to super effective Hurricanes from Pelipper, and\nSteel\nTera Type opens it up to Hariyama and (to a lesser extent) Kingambit.\nTailwind offense teams\nYou can lead Drednaw + Pelipper with Kingambit and usually Meowscarada in the back. Meowscarada + Pelipper is also a solid lead against this archetype. This is slightly dependent on the other teammates of Murkrow and Gholdengo, but these four in some order are usually my gameplan.\nThis one heavily leans into Farigiraf since it is immune to Rage Fist. If the Maushold doesn\u2019t have Population Bomb, Farigiraf can be led to immediately get speed control for Pelipper. If it does have Population Bomb, you need to remove Maushold first.\nHard Trick Room teams\nKingambit deals with almost everything with the help of Rain or Terastallization to Flying. Bring Kingambit, Pelipper, Farigiraf and Meowscarada or Hariyama and keep weather control. If the opposing team\u2019s main way of setting up Trick Room is Fake Out, Farigiraf + an offensive Pok\u00e9mon is a good lead just to get guaranteed damage on turn 1 or possibly reverse Trick Room.\nRain teams with Palafin\nThe Trick Room route is usually better because most of the opposing team is bulky enough to withstand the Rain offense mode. Farigiraf is good offensively as well as for blocking priority, but makes you very vulnerable to Kingambit or Gholdengo if you get out of position. Kingambit is very strong, but be wary of possible Fighting coverage on Palafin or Kingambit. Pelipper is also an option to help remove Amoonguss quicker and protect against Gholdengo\u2019s Make It Rain.\nBalanced teams\nThe gameplan generally centers around Kingambit or the Rain mode, utilizing Terastallization at the correct time and out-offensing them. Farigiraf is a nice option\u00a0because these teams generally have a lot of priority options. However, if there is a Poison Tera Type Garganacl, Farigiraf is mandatory and the Rain mode is less strong because Farigiraf is the only Pok\u00e9mon that can do strong damage to Garganacl after it Terastallizes. Since Salt Cure removes \u00bc of Steel- and Water-type Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s health each turn, bringing Kingambit and the Rain mode leaves you very vulnerable to Garganacl.\nTournament run\nBeing the first US regional of Scarlet and Violet, it was expected that there would be technical difficulties.\nShoutout to the TOs\nfor doing all they could to try to make it run as smoothly as possible. Playing 10 rounds was incredibly draining, but we were able to finish quicker than I expected.\nWith that said, this was my run at\nSan Diego Regionals\n!\nSwiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWLW\nMarcus Dion\n(\nFather Dijon\n)\nR2\nWW\nLonness Valenna\n(Lonness)\nR3\nLWW\nJustin Carris\n(\nAzazeL\n)\nR4\nLWW\nCedric Bernier\n(\nCedric\n)\nR5\nWLW\nLou Akcos-Cromie\n(\nKiara\n)\nR6\nLWW\nAndrew Nowak\n(\nNovechkin\n)\nR7\nLL\nSohaib Mufti\n(\nSoh\n)\nR8\nWW\nJuan Sandoval\n(\nBiscuit\n)\nR9\nWW\nJoseph Ugarte\n(\nJoeUX9\n)\nR10\nLL\nJeudy Azzarelli\n(\nJeudy\n)\nTop cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 32\nLWW\nAlberto Renero\n(\nGoldenEmp\n)\nHeat Rotom was very annoying with its ability to spread burns.

However, Meowscarada and Pelipper were able to provide a lot of offensive pressure and win the set for me.\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWLW\nGiovanni Costa\n(\nGio\u2122\n)\nI wanted to bring Farigiraf games 1 and 2 because I was scared of Talonflame, Gothitelle, and Dragonite. I got very lucky game 1 and won, but got a little unlucky game 2 and lost. I decided to switch to Drednaw in game 3 because Farigiraf was not doing enough and was too passive. I was able to get a key read correct late in the game and was able to win game 3 and the set!\nYou can\nwatch\nmy top 8 set against Giovanni here, starting at\n2:56:47\n!:\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 4\nLL\nJiseok Lee\n(\n282\n)\nI expected Gholdengo in game 1 to counter my Farigiraf and led Meowscarada + Kingambit. I misplayed my good position and made an incorrect call in the endgame, losing game 1. I kept the same Pok\u00e9mon for game 2 because I was still worried about Gholdengo and I expected him to keep the same lead because he won game 1 pretty convincingly, but he switched to Garganacl. Salt Cure destroys my team and without Farigiraf, I had no way to damage it after it Terastallized to Poison.\nYou can\nwatch\nmy top 4 set against Jiseok here, starting at\n4:37:01\n!:\nConclusion\nThis team was a blast to pilot. I had so much fun this weekend. I am super happy and feel very lucky that I was able to place top 4 at\nSan Diego Regionals\n, especially considering it was my first-ever Regional. I\u2019m looking forward to the rest of the season, this\nwill hopefully not be the last time you hear of me\n.\nHuge shoutout to all my\nfriends\nwho helped me before and during the tournament, you know who you are.\nFeel free to contact me through my\nTwitter\n.
