My name is\n\u00c1lex Soto\nand I have been playing Pok\u00e9mon VGC since\n2013\n. In 2016 I started traveling to compete, and at that moment I realized that I wanted to dedicate myself to this. I currently do live streams on\nTwitch\nand upload videos to\nYouTube\nwith the aim of sharing with others everything I have learned over the years \ud83d\ude42\nTable of Contents\nThe Team\nThe\nLiverpool Regionals\nhas been incredible! Although the\nSeries 1\nformat is already ending, I will show you my team with which I got the\nsecond position\n. I hope you like the idea and that you try it for the following formats.\nDon\u2019t underestimate hard Trick Room!\nI thought that people were paying attention to the Rain teams and Dondozo teams and they forgot about hard Trick Room teams, so I wanted to take this opportunity to create a team just for this tournament and it worked very well: people were not prepared!\nThe idea of the team is very simple:\nset the Trick Room and try to win in 4 turns\n. That\u2019s why I finished the battles so quickly!\nThis is the team. Now let\u2019s focus on the function of each Pok\u00e9mon!\nFind a paste of the team\nhere\n!\nIndeedee-F\n@ Psychic Seed\nAbility: Psychic Surge\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD\nRelaxed Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Helping Hand\n\u2013 Follow Me\n\u2013 Trick Room\nFemale Indeedee\ncan now learn Trick Room! This Pok\u00e9mon is very useful for its ability, Psychic Surge, which powers up Armarouge\u2019s and Hatterene\u2019s Psychic-type moves, as well as preventing the opponent from using priority moves like Fake Out. Also with the Follow Me move it does very well against the Maushold + Annihilape duo, preventing the Maushold from using Beat Up. Finally, the Psychic Seed is the best item! Since in this way the Knock Off of the Meowscarada does not deal that much damage to you! The Grass Tera Type is to be immune to Amoonguss\u2019s Spore \ud83d\ude09\nDefensive calcs\n252 Atk\nChoice Band\nMeowscarada\nKnock Off\nvs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Indeedee-F: 140-168 (79 \u2013 94.9%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252+ SpA\nChoice Specs\nGholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs. +1 252 HP / 4 SpD Indeedee-F: 81-96 (45.7 \u2013 54.2%) \u2014 47.3% chance to 2HKO\n252 SpA Hydreigon\nDraco Meteor\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Indeedee-F\non a critical hit\n: 156-184 (88.1 \u2013 103.9%) \u2014 31.3% chance to OHKO\n252+ Atk Kingambit\nKowtow Cleave\nvs. 252 HP / 252+ Def Indeedee-F: 152-182 (85.8 \u2013 102.8%) \u2014 12.5% chance to OHKO\nArmarouge\n@ Twisted Spoon\nAbility: Flash Fire\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpA\nQuiet Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Psychic\n\u2013 Heat Wave\n\u2013 Expanding Force\n\u2013 Trick Room\nArmarouge\nis by far the best Pok\u00e9mon on the team, as it pressures with Expanding Force and can set up Trick Room. I think Twisted Spoon is a good item because it has two Psychic-type moves. I run Psychic and Expanding Force so I can do well against Pelipper and Garganacl with Wide Guard! The Grass Tera Type is also to avoid Amonguss putting you to sleep. Also, take advantage of its Flash Fire ability very well, since they can\u2019t use super-effective Fire-type moves on you!\nOffensive calcs\n252+ SpA Tera-Grass Armarouge\nHeat Wave\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Meowscarada: 174-206 (114.4 \u2013 135.5%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Tera-Grass Armarouge\nHeat Wave\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Gholdengo\nin Sun\n: 212-252 (130 \u2013 154.6%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Twisted Spoon Tera-Grass Armarouge\nHelping Hand\nExpanding Force\n(120 BP) vs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Garchomp\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 217-256 (118.5 \u2013 139.8%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Twisted Spoon Tera-Grass Armarouge\nHelping Hand\nExpanding Force\n(120 BP) vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Palafin-Hero\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 213-252 (102.8 \u2013 121.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n252 Atk Meowscarada\nKnock Off\n(97.5 BP) vs. 252 HP / 4 Def Armarouge: 150-176 (78.1 \u2013 91.6%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 SpA Glimmora\nPower Gem\nvs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Armarouge: 168-198 (87.5 \u2013 103.1%) \u2014 25% chance to OHKO\n252 SpA Hydreigon\nDark Pulse\nvs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Armarouge: 162-192 (84.3 \u2013 100%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\n252+ SpA\nChoice Specs\nGholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs. 252 HP / 0 SpD\nTera-Grass\nArmarouge: 153-181 (79.6 \u2013 94.2%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nTorkoal\n@ Charcoal\nAbility: Drought\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 SpA / 4 SpD\nQuiet Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Eruption\n\u2013 Flamethrower\n\u2013 Earth Power\n\u2013 Clear Smog\nTorkoal\nin Trick Room is the best Pok\u00e9mon against Dondozo! With Clear Smog, you can reset Dondozo\u2019s stat changes first, so Dondozo can faint from a Psychic or Expanding Force afterwards!\nThe purpose of Eruption is doing a lot of damage in harsh sunlight. I chose Flamethrower instead of Heat Wave because the Wide Guard move was being used a lot and Meowscarada already faints with Eruption even with low health! Earth Power is for a bit of coverage, but I do regret it a bit as I think Solar Beam does better against Gastrodon. Held item Charcoal makes Torkoal deal more damage and Fire Tera Type, even more!\nOffensive calcs\n252+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nHelping Hand\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Meowscarada in Sun: 764-900 (502.6 \u2013 592.1%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n(lmao!)\n252+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 252 HP / 0 SpD\nTera-Flying\nGholdengo in Sun: 208-246 (107.2 \u2013 126.8%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nHelping Hand\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Sylveon in Sun: 228-270 (112.8 \u2013 133.6%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 180 HP / 0 SpD Annihilape in Sun: 208-246 (100 \u2013 118.2%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nHelping Hand\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Hydreigon in Sun: 156-184 (92.8 \u2013 109.5%) \u2014 56.3% chance to OHKO\n(WTF!)\n252+ SpA Charcoal\nTera-Fire\nTorkoal\nEruption\n(150 BP) vs. 252 HP / 60 SpD\nAssault Vest\nKingambit in Sun: 272-324 (131.4 \u2013 156.5%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n252+ SpA\nChoice Specs\nGholdengo\nShadow Ball\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Tera-Fire Torkoal: 151-178 (85.3 \u2013 100.5%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\n+2\n252+ Atk Tera-Dragon Dondozo\nWave Crash\nvs. 252 HP / 0 Def Tera-Fire Torkoal in Sun: 140-168 (79 \u2013 94.9%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n204+ Atk Tyranitar\nRock Slide\nvs. 252 HP / 0 Def Tera-Fire Torkoal: 78-92 (44 \u2013 51.9%) \u2014 8.6% chance to 2HKO\nKingambit\n@ Safety Goggles\nAbility: Defiant\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD\nBrave Nature\nIVs: 0 Spe\n\u2013 Kowtow Cleave\n\u2013 Iron Head\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Swords Dance\nI needed a Pok\u00e9mon that would do well against Snarl spam, so I decided to go with\nKingambit\n, since this way I can switch out and get to +2 Attack because of Defiant! Then I realized that it suffered a lot against Amoonguss, so in the end I put the Safety Googles on it. With Swords Dance it can dance in front of Amoonguss! Also, Sucker Punch works very well for when the Psychic Terrain disappears, that way you can KO many Pok\u00e9mon if Swords Dance has been used! Dark Tera Type is very good at doing maximum damage and removing the Fire- and Ground-type weaknesses.\nOffensive calcs\n+2\n252+ Atk Kingambit\nIron Head\nvs. 4 HP / 0 Def Meowscarada: 205-243 (134.8 \u2013 159.8%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ Atk Kingambit\nKowtow Cleave\nvs. 4 HP / 0 Def Gholdengo: 170-204 (104.2 \u2013 125.1%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n+2\n252+ Atk\nTera-Dark\nKingambit\nKowtow Cleave\nvs. 116 HP / 252 Def\nTera-Fire\nSylveon: 226-266 (122.1 \u2013 143.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n+2\n252+ Atk Tera-Dark Kingambit\nIron Head\nvs. 4 HP / 0 Def Hydreigon: 169-199 (100.5 \u2013 118.4%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n+2\n252+ Atk\nTera-Dark\nKingambit\nKowtow Cleave\nvs. 236 HP / 156+ Def Amoonguss: 216-256 (98.6 \u2013 116.8%) \u2014 93.8% chance to OHKO\n+2\n252+ Atk\nTera-Dark\nKingambit\nSucker Punch\nvs. 0 HP / 0 Def Garchomp: 188-222 (102.7 \u2013 121.3%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n+2\n252+ Atk Kingambit\nKowtow Cleave\nvs. 252 HP / 4 Def Palafin: 211-249 (101.9 \u2013 120.2%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n252 Atk Meowscarada\nLow Kick\n(100 BP) vs. 252 HP / 0 Def Kingambit: 176-208 (85 \u2013 100.4%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\n252+ SpA\nTera-Fire\nSylveon\nTera Blast\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Kingambit: 152-182 (73.4 \u2013 87.9%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n+2\n252+ Atk Dondozo\nWave Crash\nvs. 252 HP / 0 Def Kingambit: 160-190 (77.2 \u2013 91.7%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252 SpA\nLife Orb\nTera-Fire\nHydreigon\nHeat Wave\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Kingambit: 174-205 (84 \u2013 99%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nHatterene\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Magic Bounce\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 212 HP / 44 Def / 252 SpA\nQuiet Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Psychic\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Mystical Fire\n\u2013 Trick Room\nHatterene\nhas lost a lot of potential since it now doesn\u2019t learn Expanding Force. Still, it still works great! Thanks to its Magic Bounce ability, it can bounce the Taunts and Spores that the opponent uses on you. This way, if the opposing Amoonguss Terastallizes to Dark to become immune to Psychic-type moves, I can switch into Hatterene and bounce the Spore and put it to sleep! Life Orb item is to do maximum damage possible with three moves that have different types. Fire Tera Type is to be able to endure Steel-type moves and to be able to do more damage to Gholdengo with Mystical Fire.\nOffensive calcs\n252+ SpA Life Orb Hatterene\nDazzling Gleam\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Meowscarada: 198-237 (130.2 \u2013 155.9%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Life Orb\nTera-Fire\nHatterene\nMystical Fire\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Gholdengo: 205-244 (125.7 \u2013 149.6%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Life Orb Tera-Fire Hatterene\nPsychic\nvs. 236 HP / 116 SpD Amoonguss\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 307-367 (140.1 \u2013 167.5%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Life Orb Tera-Fire Hatterene\nDazzling Gleam\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Garchomp: 174-205 (94.5 \u2013 111.4%) \u2014 62.5% chance to OHKO\n252+ SpA Life Orb Tera-Fire Hatterene\nPsychic\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Maushold\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 185-218 (102.2 \u2013 120.4%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Life Orb\nTera-Fire\nHatterene\nMystical Fire\nvs. 252 HP / 40 SpD\nAssault Vest\nKingambit\nin Sun\n: 211-250 (101.9 \u2013 120.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ SpA Life Orb Tera-Fire Hatterene\nPsychic\nvs. 116 HP / 0 SpD Rotom-Wash\nin Psychic Terrain\n: 140-165 (100 \u2013 117.8%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n252 Atk\nChoice Band\nMeowscarada\nFlower Trick\nvs. 216 HP / 44 Def Hatterene on a critical hit: 118-141 (74.2 \u2013 88.6%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252+ SpA\nChoice Specs\nGholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs. 252 HP / 0 SpD\nTera-Fire\nHatterene: 63-74 (38.4 \u2013 45.1%) \u2014 guaranteed 3HKO\nAnnihilape\n@ Choice Scarf\nAbility: Defiant\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Shadow Claw\n\u2013 U-turn\n\u2013 Final Gambit\nAnnihilape\nis a bomb!\n(Lmao!)\nThanks to its Final Gambit move and massive amount of HP, it can one-hit most Pok\u00e9mon in the game. This move is great as you get two things done: make a Pok\u00e9mon faint and be able to switch in with a Pok\u00e9mon that does well in Trick Room like Torkoal or Armarouge! This Pok\u00e9mon works very well against double target match-ups, such as Garchomp with Earthquake + Gholdengo with Make it Rain, as they are capable of ignoring Indeedee\u2019s Follow Me. The Choice Scarf is to ensure being the fastest Pok\u00e9mon in the game. Ghost Tera Type is to pressure other Annihilape and other Gholdengo with Shadow Claw.\nOffensive calcs\n4 Atk\nTera-Ghost\nAnnihilape\nHelping Hand\nShadow Claw\nvs. 4 HP / 0 Def Gholdengo: 188-224 (115.3 \u2013 137.4%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n4 Atk\nTera-Ghost\nAnnihilape\nHelping Hand\nShadow Claw\nvs. 252 HP / 0 Def Annihilape: 216-256 (99.5 \u2013 117.9%) \u2014 93.8% chance to OHKO\n4 Atk Annihilape\nClose Combat\nvs. 4 HP / 0 Def Meowscarada: 204-242 (134.2 \u2013 159.2%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n4 Atk Annihilape\nClose Combat\nvs. 4 HP / 0 Def Hydreigon: 168-200 (100 \u2013 119%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n4 Atk Annihilape\nClose Combat\nvs. 252 HP / 0 Def Maushold: 204-242 (112.7 \u2013 133.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n4 Atk Annihilape\nClose Combat\nvs. 252 HP / 0 Def Kingambit: 268-316 (129.4 \u2013 152.6%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nAnnihilape\nFinal Gambit\nvs. 252 HP Eevee: 217-217 (133.9 \u2013 133.9%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n(<3)\nHow to use the team\nThe team is very easy to use and that helped me have a good concentration during the tournament \ud83d\ude0a\nOpponent\u2019s team\nComments\nGeneral rule\nAs a rule, the best lead is\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nand at the back\nTorkoal\nand\nHatterene\nor\nKingambit\n. I use Kingambit especially when there is Amoonguss or Snarl spam. Although in some other match-ups against Garganacl it also works very well.\nImprison + Trick Room teams\nAgainst these match-ups I use\nIndeedee + Annihilape\nto try and quickly defeat the Pok\u00e9mon that uses Imprison.\nAgainst these teams I usually run\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nand leave Torkoal with Clear Smog for when Indeedee faints.\nRain teams\nAgainst Rain teams I usually run\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nand leave Torkoal and Kingambit in the back.\nAgainst Maushold + Annihilape I go back to\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nand use Follow Me so that the opponent can\u2019t self-Beat Up.\nAgainst Murkrow + Gholdengo I use\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nagain and leave Torkoal + Hatterene in the back.\nTournament run\nThis was my run at\nLiverpool Regionals\n!\nSwiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nW\nAsra Stone\n(\nBread\n)\nR2\nW\nArthur Glandier\n(\nKsomon\n)\nR3\nW\nDaniele Serini\n(\nDaniele\n)\nR4\nW\nNico D.
