I\u2019m\nJustin Knox\n, often go by\n45mice\nonline. I currently live in Columbus, Ohio, but grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana. I got started with competitive Pok\u00e9mon very early in\nSword\n&\nShield\n. My very first-ever tournament was actually\na Victory Road tournament\n! I ended up going 8-1, then got destroyed by\nTaran Birdee\nin top cut, so it\u2019s a very surreal moment for me to be able to write a team report for where it all got started for me.\nI don\u2019t get to do tournaments too often just because of my schedule. I went to 2 during the\nSword\n&\nShield\nera, the best was just top 64 at\nIndianapolis Regional\nin 2022. Coming into\nScarlet\n&\nViolet\n, I felt I had progressed to start making some serious runs after learning all I could from\nSword\n&\nShield\n. My first IRL tournament of\nScarlet\n&\nViolet\nwas the\nFort Wayne Regional\n, where I finished 18th with\nSantino\u2019s Jumpfluff sun\n! It was\nmy first day 2 event\n, and I learned so much from talking with top players.\nIn this report, I\u2019ll talk about my thought process heading into\nNorth America International Championships\nand how I got\nTop 8\n.\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nComing into North America International Championships, the\nRegulation Set C\nmeta felt very defined and I was determined to find a way to break it. I knew I wanted to beat the meta, not be it. So I spent hours just scrolling down Pok\u00e9mon Showdown\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon list looking at unexpected options that were maybe underused. I knew I wanted to be solid against Ting-Lu Balance, Beat Up Annihilape, and Dondozo which I saw as the biggest threats.\nScreens\nis a comfort pick for me. I enjoy being able to outbulk and outposition people and be able to withstand their onslaught and hit back even harder. Thunder Wave spam is also great for\nspeed control\n, and your opponent can\u2019t win if they can\u2019t move. So I began testing it extensively before\nFresno\n. The core was always Grimmsnarl, Gholdengo, Iron Hands, and Gyarados.\nThis is an extremely solid core in which the Pok\u00e9mon cover each other well defensively.\nGyarados\nis an Intimidate user to keep Gholdengo safe with great utility.\nGholdengo\nis a Ghost type to switch in on those pesky Extreme Speed Dragonite, with one of the best abilities in the game to essentially completely ignore Amoonguss and status moves in general.\nIron Hands\ngets Fake Out while also being a very bulky with great sustain with Swords Dance + Drain Punch. The idea would be to generally to lead\nGrimmsnarl + Gyarados\n, set up screens, chip things, and get in your sweepers to set up under safe conditions.\nWhen looking at the meta\nthreats\n, I could not solve the matchup of Maushold + Annihilape with the last two slots. Screens felt too passive, and they\u2019d be able to set up their combo freely for the sweep. Dondozo also felt tricky, as the lack of immediate offensive threats usually meant Dondozo was able to eventually wear you down with its sustain and ignoring your set up.\nI kept an eye on the last Regional results before North America International Championships, and saw\nPatrick Donegan\nhad gotten\nTop 16 at Fresno\nwith screens and a very similar core! But with\nTing-Lu\nand\nFlutter Mane\nin the last spots. The issues against Annihilape and Dondozo continued, but I was encouraged that screens could have a great result.\nI was talking with my building partner\nWill Scully\n(\nAlly\n), and he mentioned\nIron Moth\nas a possible underrated Pok\u00e9mon with Flutter Mane. We tried it on more aggressive Tailwind comps, but it didn\u2019t seem to fit. Then I had the idea to put it with the Grimmsnarl + Gholdengo core I\u2019d already been working with. The idea was that the\nIron Moth + Flutter Mane core\nsolved Screens\u2019 major issues with Annihilape and helped with Dondozo, while Iron Moth gave Gholdengo much appreciated support with Acid Spray. Iron Moth ended up being an incredibly important part of the team which carried me to many victories, and further improved the\nBalance\nmatchup.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nGrimmsnarl\n@ Light Clay\nAbility: Prankster\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 124 Def / 116 SpD / 12 Spe\nCareful Nature\n\u2013 Reflect\n\u2013 Light Screen\n\u2013 Thunder Wave\n\u2013 Spirit Break\nGrimmsnarl is\nthe key\nto the whole team and probably my most brought Pok\u00e9mon next to Gholdengo.\nIt\u2019s got great typing with a wide variety of support moves. I had messed around with Parting Shot as an option, which wasn\u2019t bad but Prankster\nThunder Wave\nended up being very crucial to match-ups with Annihilape. You bring Grimmsnarl in the back if they have Tailwind supporting their Annihilape (like on\nZachary Thornberg\n\u2019s\nteam\n), Thunder Wave it and now your faster threats of Iron Moth, Flutter Mane, and (usually) Gholdengo outspeed it again. So Thunder Wave stayed.\nSpirit Break\nis great for chipping Chi-Yu, Ting-Lu, Iron Hands, and other specially oriented Pok\u00e9mon, doing great damage and lowering their Special Attack by one stage.\nIt has\nGhost\nTera Type to avoid Fake Out in some situations, and for extra support versus Gothitelle, as you can Terastallize, then swap out Grimmsnarl next turn if needed. It was not Terastallized often, as usually it was better spent on other options. But it was a nice option to have.\nDefensive calcs\n252+ SpA Choice Specs\nGholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs. 252 HP / 116+ SpD Grimmsnarl\nthrough\nLight Screen\n: 169-200 (83.6 \u2013 99%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nGholdengo\n@ Leftovers\nAbility: Good as Gold\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 156 HP / 4 Def / 140 SpA / 4 SpD / 204 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Make It Rain\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Nasty Plot\n\u2013 Protect\nProbably the most brought Pok\u00e9mon of the entire tournament. This\nGholdengo\nis a mix of bulk and tries to outspeed most Annihilape, Palafin (which was to be able to hit Palafin before it Hazed away your boosts), and Gyarados.\nIt\u2019s bringable into almost any match up, and can provide immediate offense with\nMake It Rain\n, status immunity which is great vs Glimmora and Amoonguss, and Ghost typing to swap in on obvious\nExtreme Speeds\n.\nIt has\nWater\nTera Type to resist Water and Fire and be neutral to Ground and Ghost. It gives it the best defensive combo. Leftovers gives it great sustain, and you can\nNasty Plot\nup safely behind screens and slowly heal any chip you may have taken.\nOffensive calcs\n+2\n140+ SpA Gholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs.\n-2\n100 HP / 252 SpD\nAssault Vest Vessel of Ruin\nTing-Lu: 144-171 (59.2 \u2013 70.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n+1\n140+ SpA Gholdengo\nMake It Rain\nvs.\n-2\n100 HP / 252 SpD\nAssault Vest Vessel of Ruin\nTing-Lu: 108-127 (44.4 \u2013 52.2%) \u2014 17.2% chance to 2HKO\nDefensive calcs\n156+ Atk\nTing-Lu\nStomping Tantrum\nvs. 156 HP / 4 Def Gholdengo\nthrough Reflect\n: 80-96 (43.9 \u2013 52.7%) \u2014 guaranteed 3HKO after Leftovers recovery\nGyarados\n@ Sitrus Berry\nAbility: Intimidate\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 236 HP / 4 Atk / 44 Def / 4 SpD / 220 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Waterfall\n\u2013 Thunder Wave\n\u2013 Taunt\n\u2013 Protect\nThis Gyarados is\nfast\n. Intentionally so, mainly because\nTaunt\nGyarados wars were so important in the\nBalance\nmatchup, I wanted to be sure I was faster. With screens and\nIntimidate\n, I found there wasn\u2019t a lot of defensive calcs I wasn\u2019t already hitting with\nmax HP\n. I could EV train it to live a Choice Specs Flutter Mane\u2019s\u00a0Thunderbolt with Light Screen, but that would require almost max Careful investment and was not worth it.\nFast Gyarados let me outspeed some Arcanine and Taunt before they could Will-o-Wisp (very important in my match vs\nPaul Chua\n). I also outsped some bulky\nChi-Yu\nwhich can be very useful.\nFairy\nTera Type was the best balance between being neutral to most things and letting Gyarados\u2019s great natural bulk and screens do the work.\nDefensive calcs\n252+ Atk Choice Band Sword of Ruin Tera-Normal\nDragonite\nExtreme Speed\nvs. 236 HP / 44 Def Gyarados: 175-207 (87.5 \u2013 103.5%) \u2014 18.8% chance to OHKO\n116+ SpA Choice Specs\nFlutter Mane\nMoonblast\nvs. 236 HP / 4 SpD Gyarados through Light Screen: 83-98 (41.5 \u2013 49%) \u2014 100% chance to 3HKO after Sitrus Berry recovery\nIron Hands\n@ Lum Berry\nAbility: Quark Drive\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 68 HP / 76 Atk / 28 Def / 252 SpD / 84 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Drain Punch\n\u2013 Wild Charge\n\u2013 Fake Out\n\u2013 Swords Dance\nIron Hands was probably my least brought Pok\u00e9mon, and I probably should\u2019ve brought it a bit more than I did. I sometimes faulted too much back to the classic Grimmsnarl + Gholdengo, like in my\nTop 8\nmatch vs\nV\u00edctor Medina\n(\nTorviv\n) instead of mixing it up.\nFake Out\nwas mainly useful for slowing down Choice Specs Chi-Yu and general annoyance and positioning, otherwise pretty standard Swords Dance, Wild Charge and Drain Punch.\nI decided to go with\nLum Berry\nbecause I hated how I had to Terastallize into a Fire-type in the\nBalance\nmatchup to not get burned, and I hated Terastallizing and still being weak to Ground and adding a Water weakness.\nGrass\nTera Type felt like the best option, and Lum forced opponents to try and hit 2 Will-o-Wisps on it if they really wanted it burned, which usually gave you enough time to deal with the Will-o-Wisp user or dodge one.\nIt has\nSpeed\ninvestment to outspeed most Iron Hands (which wins you the mirror) and Swords Dance Black Glasses Kingambit which is very important. Iron Hands is the most important Pok\u00e9mon in that matchup and one of the main answers to that threat.\nFlutter Mane\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Moonblast\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Protect\nFocus Sash\nis kind of a weird item on a screens team right? It is, but it\u2019s mainly to give this team an option of the very aggressive lead\nIron Moth\n+\nFlutter Mane\n. This lead can put a lot of pressure on\nBalance\nteams and Annihilape teams, as a double up will often kill through Friend Guard or Vessel of Ruin. Focus Sash also makes the Annihilape matchup much more secure.\nI spent all this time\nplanning for the Annihilape matchup\nto not encounter a single one the entire tournament, but glad I was prepared in the case I did get one. The line vs Annihilape is to lead Flutter Mane + Iron Moth, and target one of the slots (usually Annihilape). If they have Water Tera Type, Terastallize Flutter Mane and that plus Acid Spray from Iron Moth will KO or very nearly KO near all Annihilape. You\u2019ll always live a hit because of the Focus Sash.\nThis gave the screens team the much needed\nalternate mode\nthat was aggressive and put on immediate pressure to catch people off guard, trying to take advantage of screens passivity.\nIron Moth\n@ Booster Energy\nAbility: Quark Drive\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 44 HP / 116 Def / 92 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Heat Wave\n\u2013 Energy Ball\n\u2013 Acid Spray\n\u2013 Protect\nThen finally the star of the report!\nIron Moth\nis a good Pok\u00e9mon, but shares the unfortunate fate of filling a\nsimilar role as Chi-Yu\n. Let me be clear, Chi-Yu is better on 95% of teams than Iron Moth. On this specific team though, Iron Moth has many advantages over Chi-Yu: it is faster than Chi-Yu and Flutter Mane, and is better vs Annihilape than Chi-Yu as you don\u2019t have to Terastallize to stop Annihilape from sustaining back up from Drain Punch. It resists Flutter Mane, and wins the 1v1.\nAcid Spray\n+ its ally\u2019s move will end up dealing more single-target damage than most Chi-Yu situations, and is a long-lasting effect regardless of if Iron Moth remains on the field or not. It puts on a lot of pressure in an open-teamsheet format when you can see what Pok\u00e9mon have Choice Specs or no Protect, as it\u2019s often a free double up and KO before they can act since your Flutter Mane + Iron Moth will certainly be faster than their Flutter Mane.\nIt\u2019s EV trained to live a max Adamant Dark Tera Type- & Black Glasses-boosted Sucker Punch from Kingambit, which gives you a more aggressive line into Kingambit\nBalance\nleading Iron Moth + Flutter Mane, clicking\nHeat Wave + Dazzling Gleam\n, and pinning it.\nEnergy Ball\nis great for coverage, hits Dondozo and Palafin.\nHeat Wave\nis great for pressuring Amoonguss and Gholdengo.\nOffensive calcs\n92 SpA Iron Moth\nHeat Wave\nvs. 252 HP / 4 SpD Kingambit: 132-156 (63.7 \u2013 75.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO (\nguaranteed KO with Flutter Mane\u2019s Dazzling Gleam\n)\nDefensive calcs\n156+ Atk\nTing-Lu\nStomping Tantrum\nvs. 44 HP / 116 Def Iron Moth through Reflect: 136-160 (84.4 \u2013 99.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252+ Atk Black Glasses Tera-Dark\nKingambit\nSucker Punch\nvs. 44 HP / 116 Def Iron Moth: 136-162 (84.4 \u2013 100.6%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\nHow to use the team\nCommon match ups\nLeads\n\"Palance\" + Ting-Lu Balance\nChi-Yu + Flutter Mane\nTalonflame + Garchomp\nDondozo\nMaushold + Annihilape\nChien-Pao + Dragonite\nLeads\nClick on the tabs to see some notes!\n\"Palance\" + Ting-Lu Balance\nLead\nBack\nChi-Yu + Flutter Mane\nLead\nOr\nTalonflame + Garchomp\nLead\nUsually in back\nor\nDondozo\nLead\nUsually in back\n/\nor\nMaushold + Annihilape\nLead\nUsually in back\nor\nChien-Pao + Dragonite\nLead\nTournament run\nThis was my run at\nNorth America International Championships\n!\nDay 1 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWLW\nDaniel Raygoza\n(Daniel)\nR2\nWW\nJake Marusic\n(Jake)\nR3\nWLW\nKeeno Keys\n(\nKeeno\n)\nR4\nWLL\nRaphael Bagara\n(\nRaphael\n)\nR5\nWW\nKevin Sarmiento\n(TeisonVGC)\nR6\nWW\nJefferson Camelo\n(\nKSV lJeff\n)\nR7\nWW\nDiego Aguirre\n(Diego)\nR8\nWW\nJon Hu\n(\nJHufself\n)\nR9\nLL\nJames Evans\n(\nJames\n)\nDay 2 Swiss Rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR10\nBye\nR11\nWW\nPaul Chua\n(\nPaul\n)\nR12\nWLW\nJames Evans\n(\nJames\n)\nR13\nWW\nWolfe Glick\n(\nWolfey\n)\nR14\nWW\nAlex G\u00f3mez\n(\nPokeAlex\n)\nYou can watch my\nround 11 match\nversus Paul\nhere\nand my\nround 14 match\nversus Alex G\u00f3mez\nhere\n, from 4:33:56!\nTop Cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nLL\nV\u00edctor Medina\n(\nTorviv\n)\nYou can watch my\nTop 8 match\nversus Victor Medina\nhere\n, from 7:27:43!\nFinal thoughts\nNorth America International Championships\nwas probably the most fun I\u2019ve ever had playing Pok\u00e9mon. It was a team I really enjoyed, felt good with running, and felt incredibly strong into the meta. I tend to really like trying to use underused Pok\u00e9mon and build weird teams, so this was about all I could\u2019ve ever hoped for. I\u2019ve always just wanted sets vs the best just to challenge myself. And can\u2019t imagine a more challenging and rewarding\nDay 2\nbeating 4 International (and one World) Champions in a row.\nThe team definitely could\u2019ve gone further as it was good into\nAlex G\u00f3mez\n\u2019s tour-winning team as shown on stream in\nRound 14. The match up vs\nV\u00edctor Medina\n(\nTorviv\n) was winnable, but he simply played better than me, especially G3. So he absolutely deserved the win, and couldn\u2019t have lost to a more gracious and kind person.\nI want to say a huge shout out to\nWill Scully\n(\nAlly\n) who did\n99%\nof the EV spreads and calcs. He is an EV wizard and incredible player in his own right. My run wouldn\u2019t have been possible without him supporting me.\nThanks to everyone\nI met in person\nat North America International Championships who supported my run and cheered me on, you made it an unforgettable experience.
