My name is\nLiam Gilbert\n, or as most people better refer to me as,\nGilbo\n! I am a 21-year-old Australian VGC player from Sydney, and I have been playing competitive Pok\u00e9mon since\n2015\n.\nAs a bit of background, my own personal achievements involve a mixture of both Seniors and Masters division play. In Seniors, I came top 8 at Sydney Regionals in 2015, and then 2nd place in the following year, while also getting top 16 at the Australian Nationals in both years. From 2017 onwards, I was considered a Master Division player, and ended up coming\n1st at the\nSydney Regionals in 2017\n, 2nd place at\nBrisbane Regionals in 2018\n,\n5th place at\nOCIC 2019\n, top 16 at\nSydney Regionals in 2019\n, 3rd place at\nMelbourne Regionals in 2022\n, and now\n1st place at my hometown\nSydney\nonce again\n!\nAside from my own achievements, I am also the proud brother and coach of my younger siblings\nJack\n,\nAndrew\n, and\nJames\n, who have all been playing VGC since the Junior Division for the past 8 years, and their achievements, individually and as a whole, trump mine in comparison.\nEnough about me!! I think it\u2019s time to jump into why you\u2019re reading this article, which is to see what the\nfirst\nRegulation Set C\ntournament\nwas like, what to expect, and how you should potentially approach the metagame!\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nSo first and foremost,\nSydney Regionals\nthis year was one of the largest tournaments in the Southern Hemisphere, sitting at\n189 players\ncompeting. I would be reminisced to see the Regional being discounted because the numbers may not be as high compared to other Regionals across the world. However, this has been\nour biggest Regional event since 2016\n, I believe. The players I versed all weekend were phenomenal and insanely good, and they deserve credit amongst the general populace of players that showed up. Playing in a format that was only released on the Switch on the day of the Regional goes to show that everyone pushed forward and did the very best they could, which is all anyone can ask for!\nHeading into the tournament, I did not have much practice with\nRegulation Set C\nat all, let alone VGC in general. The last tournament I played prior to Sydney Regionals was\nOCIC 2023\n, in which i finished\ntop 64\n, and then never picked up my Switch or booted up Pok\u00e9mon Showdown again.\nFast forward to like 10 days before the tournament, I totally forgot to get\nmy younger brothers\u2019 teams\nready, because unlike me, they actually have a better chance of going to Worlds, and they had already both reached the Day 1 qualification threshold. So the genius I am, I try and do the most basic team possible for them.\nThis was essentially a cop out team with how cookie cutter it was, or at least in the way I designed it. Both my younger brothers managed to use the team relatively well on such short time we had, especially with Andrew finishing\n9th in Seniors\n, and James finishing\ntop 4\n. Unfortunately, when I tried the team, I was not doing well with it. In fact, I was stuck in the 1100s on Pok\u00e9mon Showdown with it. Not the best, am I right? So like most things in life when I start failing, I turned off Showdown and procrastinated fixing my team up until the very end.\nFast forward again to 3 days before the tournament, I totally forgot I was competing. I thought I was chaperoning my younger brothers again. I already paid the $35 entry, and being from Western Sydney, $35 is like a block of gold, so I couldn\u2019t let it go to waste. So with this in mind, I hopped back on Showdown to teambuild, but I did a little bit of a time analysis of how well I could assemble my team in time, and unfortunately, factoring in work and Univeristy, I was definitely in the weeds. So I decided to try and\nadapt my OCIC team\nhere and there.\nI thought the\nFarigiraf\non my team would be great against Dragonite\u2019s Extreme Speed and Palafin\u2019s Jet Punch, while\nTorkoal\njust deals insane amounts of damage. The only slight plot twist, is that I was still stuck in the 1100s on Pok\u00e9mon Showdown!? Something was clearly not working, something was off. I tried adding all sorts of Pok\u00e9mon to help the team out, like Weakness Policy\nTing-Lu\nat one point, Assault Vest Ting-Lu, Leech Seed\nWo-Chien\n\u2026 But none of those worked! I was definitely in trouble, but I knew I had to commit to something.\nThrough all my losses, I found that Dark types were more common due to the Treasures of Ruin Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s prevalence, so automatically, I knew I needed a Fighting type. But since Dark types are increasing in usage, then surely Fighting type usage goes up too, and what are both those types weak to? Fairy! So i knew I needed a Fairy type of some sort, hence the\nFlutter Mane\n.\nI considered\nGreat Tusk\nas a great Fighting type, but its low Special Defense hinders it too much to be a source of damage and defense. I considered\nBreloom\n, because Mach Punch could hit Chien-Pao very easily, and Spore would be incredibly versatile to have, but ultimately I went with the\nIron Hands\n. I then started testing Assault Vest Iron Hands with Trick Room, but the damage output was so low, especially after being Intimidated, it just was not being optimised to its fullest potential. Then I remembered some bloke on Showdown a while back was running a Fire-Tera Type set with Swords Dance in a Showdown tournament. He got completely destroyed, but the set in theory sounded way too good to disregard. And at this stage of teambuilding being so close to the tournament, I was banking on my theory working in practice. So yeah, I decided bulky Swords Dance Iron Hands was the play with the team!\nThen I needed to add Pok\u00e9mon to set up Swords Dance, like a form of redirection, which I considered\nMaushold\nfor initially, but\nAmoonguss\nworked out to be better. I then began to add other pieces to the team like\nChien-Pao\nto meet the Treasures of Ruin quota, despite it not being used most of my games. I added\nPalafin\nbecause I had a Shiny one lying around from an egg I hatched a while back, and it looks like an evil villain when it\u2019s Shiny, plus the Haze on it was my Dondozo counter if i ever faced one\u2026 and who doesn\u2019t like a Water type on their team too? The final Pok\u00e9mon\nGothitelle\nwas the last-minute addition to the team, which I literally made on the night before the tournament, and is arguably one of the most fundamental Pok\u00e9mon on the team.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nIron Hands\n@ Safety Goggles\nAbility: Quark Drive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFire\nEVs: 196 HP / 76 Atk / 4 Def / 228 SpD / 4 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Swords Dance\n\u2013 Drain Punch\n\u2013 Wild Charge\n\u2013 Protect\nBehold and look at the monster that was the driving force behind my team! This\nIron Hands\nset was so incredibly important in every single one of my games. In fact, I brought Iron Hands to every single game I played against all my opponents due to how incredible it was. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get to give it a nickname in time, but if I did, I would call the lad\nDave\n, because he sends all his enemies to the grave.\nRegardless, this Iron Hands set was built to tank as much damage as possible, get a\nSwords Dance\nsetup, and then hit back harder with a\nDrain Punch\nor\nWild Charge\n. I do remember at one point in my Swiss games, that this Iron Hands tanked a super effective Choice Specs-boosted Dazzling Gleam, which goes to show how bulky it was.\nSome Aussie VGC players know about how notorious I am when it comes to\nEV training\n, so in full transparency, I have no idea what these EVs accomplish. I just moved the knob up and down on Pok\u00e9mon Showdown to find those juicy sweet spots. But this Iron Hands was definitely the MVP of my team without a doubt.\nFlutter Mane\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Moonblast\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Protect\nFlutter Mane\nwas kind of a standard pick I had to choose for this team. I required a Pok\u00e9mon that could beat Fighting and Dark types, and what better to choose from, than a Flutter Mane? The sheer offensive pressure paired with the\nLife Orb\njust dealt so much damage. I did consider the Choice Specs, however, I didn\u2019t like my lack of mobility and Protect with it, so I stuck with the Life Orb.\nFor those wondering, I did consider\nPerish Song\nover Moonblast or Dazzling Gleam, yes. But! The reason why I didn\u2019t use Perish Song is because it\u2019s a very passive play that is easily predictable within the team, and if you watched my stream games, I am most definitely not a passive player with this team.\nI used standard\nEVs\nfor this, because I am so incredibly lazy at EV training that I can\u2019t be stuffed, especially at 1am in the morning before the tournament starts. So max Speed, max Special Attack.\nChien-Pao\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Sword of Ruin\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Ice Spinner\n\u2013 Throat Chop\n\u2013 Sacred Sword\nThere is no denying that the Treasures of Ruin offer good offensive and defensive pressure, but the reason I chose to use\nChien-Pao\nwas because of its\nSpeed\ntier. I just needed a relatively fast Pok\u00e9mon to help deal with other Flutter Mane, which is why I chose Chien-Pao despite the potential speed ties.\nMany people have asked why I opted for\nThroat Chop\nover Sucker Punch, and that\u2019s because I needed a more definitive way to attack Arcanine, and everyone is starting to invest into their Flutter Mane to live Sucker Punches, so it became kind of redundant. Unfortunately, I did not utilise Chien-Pao as much this weekend, just because it didn\u2019t synergise as well with the team, and because my Iron Hands was too much of a monster.\nI also\nEV\ntrained it the same as the Flutter Mane, except max Attack instead of Special Attack. EV training takes too long, and everytime I do, I get hungry. I had to put a\nFocus Sash\non this Pok\u00e9mon, since it was fairly frail and I did not want to keep losing it on my first turn of games like I did prior practicing on Showdown.\nSea World\n(Palafin) @ Mystic Water\nAbility: Zero to Hero\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 76 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def / 172 SpD / 4 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Jet Punch\n\u2013 Wave Crash\n\u2013 Haze\n\u2013 Protect\nNow that we\u2019re halfway through the list of Pok\u00e9mon I used,\nPalafin\nis one Pok\u00e9mon on the team that worked and didn\u2019t work too well. I would say 9 out of 10 times, I was only utilising Palafin for reckless plays like Helping Hand + Jet Punch into Flutter Mane to try and knock it out. I also mainly used the Palafin in\nZero Form\nand not Hero Form for some odd reason, I\u2019m just built different like that, I suppose.\nOnce again, I have no ideas what the\nEVs\ndo. I think it was built for\nRegulation Set B\nliving high amounts of special-attacking damage while dealing out as much damage as possible. Regardless of how the EVs turned out, the Palafin was still incredibly useful in my games, especially the Wave Crash and Jet Punch being nice sources of damage output. I chose to use\nMystic Water\nbecause of its popularity and sheer damage output being insanely high.\nAmoonguss\n@ Wiki Berry\nAbility: Regenerator\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD\nSassy Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk / 0 Spe\n\u2013 Pollen Puff\n\u2013 Spore\n\u2013 Protect\n\u2013 Rage Powder\nAmoonguss\nwas a Pok\u00e9mon added to the team primarily for redirection to help old mate Iron Hands out, but it also worked insanely well at healing Iron Hands and its buddies up to with\nPollen Puff\n. I had no clue how amazing Pollen Puff was, to be honest, and it worked so tremendously well with the team.\nMy Amoongus\nEVs\nwere kind of the basic stock standard. Max HP, enough Special Defense EVs to hit that little sweet spot, and the rest in Defense. If you ended up watching my stream prior, you can tell how dodgy these EVs ultimately were, as I barely lived a Dragonite\u2019s Choice Band-boosted Extreme Speed, and it fainted to a regular Arcanine\u2019s Flare Blitz that wasn\u2019t even holding a Choice Band or boosted. So suffice to say, I should have definitely booted up the damage calculator for this one. The item was a\nWiki Berry\nbecause Gothitelle has the Sitrus Berry, and it was the only other item I had on hand.\nGothitelle\n(F) @ Sitrus Berry\nAbility: Shadow Tag\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD\nCalm Nature\n\u2013 Trick Room\n\u2013 Fake Out\n\u2013 Psychic\n\u2013 Helping Hand\nThe final Pok\u00e9mon of the team was indeed the\nGothitelle\n, the notorious last-minute addition to tie everything together. As I stated in my round 3 interview, I did come up with this as I was cooking up a brisket at work. I had a moment of clarity as I was breathing in some wood pellets and thought, \u201cWait a sec, what if my opponent just can\u2019t switch out their Pok\u00e9mon, they can\u2019t deal with my Iron Hands\u201d, and then the second I got home, I pulled an old Gothitelle out, reset the EVs and went to town on it.\nThe idea was\nFake Out\nwith it so that Iron Hands could use Swords Dance, but I rarely even got to use that combination unfortunately. Trick room was also nice to have since it gave my Iron Hands and Amoonguss speed control, and I could reverse the opposing team\u2019s Trick Room quite easily.\nPsychic\nwas a must to have, I needed to hit Amoonguss hard, and I just needed some form of damage in case I got taunted. The final move was a throw up between\nHelping Hand\nand\nProtect\n, both of which would have been good, but I ultimately chose Helping Hand just so I could go for fast hyper-offensive plays to get fast knockouts, which I did a few times throughout all my matches.\nThe\nEVs\nI hate to say were just moved around with the Showdown knob. I\u2019m not sure what the EVs do, but I ended up living like 9 Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Balls from Flutter Mane the entire weekend each and every time! I know, right? What an insanely awesome coincidence\u2026 The numbers agreed with me for once. But yes, this Gothitelle was absolutely insane, I love it so much.\nHow to use the team\nFor those wondering how to use the team, I would recommend testing and working around it first to kind of sus out what feels comfortable to you. My ideal plan was to\nFake Out with Gothitelle + Swords Dance\nas mentioned above, but ultimately I went for plays such as Helping Hand + Moonblast, Helping Hand + Jet Punch, or Trick Room and offensive pressure. My aim for using the team was to definitely throw all my opponents off and hit them where it was unexpected, since my play style is very unorthodox sometimes. But to get things started, definitely\ntry positioning yourself in Trick Room\nso your Iron Hands can be set up to sweep, since that was the key to all my game successes.\nTournament run\nThis was my run at\nSydney Regionals\n!\nDay 1 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nDavid Posniak\n(Ser Davos)\nR2\nWW\nPatrick Gregorowski\n(EVERLANCE)\nR3\nWW\nChamath Abeyawardana\n(\nSamus\n)\nR4\nLWW\nNicholas Kan\n(Nicholas)\nR5\nWW\nXiong Ziyue\n(\ngoodwill\n)\nR6\nWW\nEmma Williams\n(\nCobalte\n)\nR7\nWW\nAlister Sandover\n(\nAlister\n)\nR8\nWW\nDaniel Walker\n(Daniel)\nNotes\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nR6\nR7\nR8\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nDavid Posniak\n(Ser Davos)\nI have the memory of a goldfish, but against David in the first round, I saw his team being incredibly formidable against my team. The Kingambit and Great Tusk were the two I was the most afraid of due to their sheer damage output.\nI forgot how Game 1 went, but I do remember that in Game 2 the final turns came down to him predicting Sucker Punch into the correct slot, which I fortunately was able to read.\nDavid was also an incredibly nice player to verse, so massive shoutout to him, and he did great with his Regional run too!\nR2\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR2\nWW\nPatrick Gregorowski\n(EVERLANCE)\nAgainst Patrick, he had quite the formidable team once again. Sydney is relentless at providing me with challenges to face, and Patrick lived up to it with his six. From my perspective, that Dragonite was an immediate threat, and I did not want to play against it.\nI do not remember how the matches went entirely, but all I can recall is that I was able to position my Iron Hands into a spot that allowed me to provide pressure against his Chi-Yu + Flutter Mane combination which helped me win both games fortunately.\nJust like David before, Patrick was a top bloke and player, and he finished really great too!\nR3\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR3\nWW\nChamath Abeyawardana\n(\nSamus\n)\nChamath was an absolute blast to play and he was so delightful to talk to. I believe he told me he and his friend came all the way down from Brisbane, which is quite the journey having trekked up there a few times. Chamath ended up using a team which once again was quite strong against my core. Most notably, his Ting-Lu had Fissure on it, which was quite scary, seeing how a 30% chance to KO me is 30% too much for my liking.\nMy mindset going into this game was like prior games; get Trick Room set up and put Iron Hands into a position where it can sweep. Unfortunately his Arcanine carried Safety Goggles which was a bit of a pickle to work around, and the Choice Specs Flutter Mane dealt so much damage to my Gothitelle that he had a lot of offensive pressure on me. Ultimately, the Iron Hands in both games I believe was positioned in a spot next to Amoonguss that allowed me to redirect moves and apply large sums of damage to him.\nR4\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR4\nLWW\nNicholas Kan\n(Nicholas)\nOut of everyone I could have faced at the Regional, it just had to be a Kan, and not just any Kan, but the one that recently came\n2nd at\nWorlds in 2022\n, and\nwon a\nWorld Championship in 2017\n. Nick is definitely not a player to sleep on despite being a first-year Master. He is a phenomenal Master Division player and it goes to show in his tournament runs and play styles.\nGoing into the matchup, I was already nervous being on stream since everyone on Twitch can see me! I get very camera-shy as I\u2019m sure you could all see in my interviews, but I tried to focus on push through the games. You can watch the full rundown of how all the games went on Twitch, but ultimately, I played Game 1 awfully with the turn 1 Water Tera Type-boosted Wave Crash at -1 Attack not picking up the knockout. However, I was able to pull it back in Games 2 and 3, thankfully.\nR5\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR5\nWW\nXiong Ziyue\n(\ngoodwill\n)\nIn Round 5 I versed Xiong Ziyue, who I unfortunately did not get the opportunity to talk to as much, but he was still fun to play against regardless. Ziyue had a team in which 5 out of 6 of his Pok\u00e9mon were the same as mine. So in a sense, this was a mirror matchup aside from him having Arcanine over my Gothitelle.\nI can\u2019t remember the matches too much, but I distinctly remember Gothitelle setting up Trick Room, and providing a substantial amount of pressure with my own Iron Hands. Since he did not have Clear Smog on his Amoonguss, I was able to have my Iron Hands sweep through pretty uncontested.\nI saw that Ziyue also finished really strong this tournament too, so massive congratulations to him on that!\nR6\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR6\nWW\nEmma Williams\n(\nCobalte\n)\nIn Round 6, I played against Emma Williams, who I believe is quite the reputable player in the Australian VGC community. I had heard of her name many times in previous articles from years ago about how good of a player she was, and I did not want to take any chances against her.\nSeeing the matchup, I immediately knew that Iron Hands was my key to success in it, especially how there were 3~4 Pok\u00e9mon weak to Fighting-type attacks. I also knew Flutter Mane would be fundamental in the matchup too, and that I could work around how she positions her team. I do unfortunately forget how the games went, but it finished with my Iron Hands in every one in a dominant position. The Ting-Lu was quite the problem in all honesty, due to it underspeeding my Iron Hands in Trick Room, and being incredibly bulk. Emma played extremely well, and am glad she finished strong this tournament too!\nR7\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR7\nWW\nAlister Sandover\n(\nAlister\n)\nOut of everyone to verse, I had to play against one of the greatest Australian VGC players in history, especially seeing how he just recently came\n2nd at\nPerth Regionals\nonly less than a month prior.\nAlister\u2019s team was incredibly well-balanced and provided flexibility to adjust. Knowing that I couldn\u2019t use a cookie-cutter type of play against Alister, I had to go for harder reads every now and then throughout our matches, and had to predict things like using Spore into his Wo-Chien slot to predict the Dragonite switch-in, and set up multiple Swords Dances to account for Intimidate being recycled in subsequent turns. I was fortunately able to clutch things out within 2 games only, which solidified my Day 1 invite as I had made top 16 at this point. I was extremely happy and over the moon!\nR8\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR8\nWW\nDaniel Walker\n(Daniel)\nDaniel Walker is one of the best VGC players to have ever been a part of Sydney, and I consider him to one of the best teambuilders out there. Out of all the teams I had played against the entire day, Daniel\u2019s had incredible offensive pressure with the Chi-Yu + special attackers combinations, and his Scizor was a major threat for my Gothitelle.\nIn Game 1, I did have to make numerous reads such as the turn 1 Helping Hand + Jet Punch with my Zero Form Palafin on his Flutter Mane. Higher-level players like Daniel require more to work around, and I had to go hard with my reads to secure the wins. Game 2 went a lot more in his favour, and we danced around for quite a bit, rotating Pok\u00e9mon and healing with Pollen Puffs. At one point towards the end, I managed to gain an advantageous position and was hoping to wrap the game up, but the timer for our match went off, and declared me the apparent victor. This was very strange for me since I had never won a game due to the timer, but apparently that was how the timer was set up to work. Still, I wished we could have seen how the game played out, as we were both eager to see the final turns of the game happen.\nI have to say, Daniel is an amazing player and person, and every match I\u2019ve had with him ever has been tremendously fun, all the way back since 2017. I really hope that Daniel manages to clutch up and go to Worlds, because he definitely deserves to be there!\nYou can watch my\nRound 4 set\nversus Nicholas\nhere\n!\nDay 2 Top Cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWLW\nAlister Sandover\n(\nAlister\n)\nTop 4\nWW\nGalvin Hui\n(\nHuid\n)\nFinals\nWLW\nSam Pandelis\n(\n\u2665Misaka\u2665\n)\nNotes\nTop 8\nTop 4\nFinals\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nTop 8\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWLW\nAlister Sandover\n(\nAlister\n)\nGoing into top cut, I was not looking forward to versing Alister again. Despite my 2-0 win against him in Swiss, it would be reckless of me to underestimate him, and it went to show, as our games were incredibly close and decisive towards the end.\nIn Game 1, I had to go for the high-risk, high-reward play and Fake Out his Flutter Mane predicting the Steel-type Terastallization. In these storts of games, playing too passively against offensive Pok\u00e9mon would definitely not have worked out for me, so I had to adapt my play style to go bold and offensive on the leads, and then passively adapt to set Iron Hands up in a strong position later. Game 1 fortunately did go in my favour, but Game 2 was a mess for me, especially when his Great Tusk came out and went for the Ground-type Terastallization to minimise the weakness from my Gothitelle\u2019s Psychic. I lost Game 2 which was fair, as Alister played phenomenal and adapted well. Game 3 was the most decisive game, as it came down to a mixture of predictions in the first turn, and predictions as to whether his Great Tusk would protect or not on the final turns. I also brought Chien-Pao for once, which was the only proper way I had to deal with his Great Tusk, aside from my Palafin, but that was threatened by Amoonguss, which is why I did not bring it. Fortunately, I managed to win the third game and advanced to\nTop 4\n.\nI have to give a massive shoutout to Alister as well. Just like the rest of the VGC players I played against, he was great to talk to, play against, and is a phenomenal VGC player. I wish him the best for\nEUIC\n, because I know he will smash it over there.\nTop 4\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 4\nWW\nGalvin Hui\n(\nHuid\n)\nTop 4 was quite the experience to be a part of. I was very excited that I made it to this position, and to have matched my results from\nMelbourne in 2022\n. Out of all the players, I was up against Galvin, who I believe I had never played before. I didn\u2019t realise until before the start of the match that Galvin was actually\n@Huid_VGC\n, which was quite the pleasant surprise! Glad to meet people that match the profiles from Twitter!\nOf all the Pok\u00e9mon on Galvin\u2019s team, the Chien-Pao + Dragonite combination was still giving me terrifying memories of Day 1, however, the Azumarill was the big threat that threw a spanner in the works for me. Our game was streamed and should be available on Twitch to watch for a more comprehensive review, but suffice to say, Galvin played incredibly well.\nIn our first game, I automatically knew I needed to go for a hard read turn 1 to apply immediate pressure. Instinctively, I had a feeling that since we had never played each other before, we might both play passively in the first game to gauge each other\u2019s play style. I decided to opt more aggressively since I knew there was a clear reason Galvin went 7-1 at this stage, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s good at the game, so my hyper-offensive first turn ended up paying dividends in the end. Ultimately, Galvin and I had many speed ties, one of which he won in Game 1, and the remainder, I fortunately won in Game 2. I will not deny that I did get lucky in Game 2 winning both Sacred Sword speed ties to win the match. If he had won those speed ties, we most definitely would have gone to a Game 3.\nMassive shoutout to Galvin once more for being an amazing VGC player and person. He was definitely a thrill to talk to and play against!\nFinals\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nFinals\nWLW\nSam Pandelis\n(\n\u2665Misaka\u2665\n)\nOut of all the finalists, it had to of course been Sam Pandelis I was facing, who is arguably Australia\u2019s\nbest VGC player of all time\n, so it was definitely terrifying to play him again, since the only times we\u2019ve ever played before were\nMelbourne Regionals in 2022\nand the\nPlayers Cup III qualifiers\n.\nGoing into the matchup against Sam, I felt a lot more confident since it was similar to most of the teams I had played prior. However, I knew the main issue wouldn\u2019t come entirely from the team I was facing, but rather the player himself, in which he played phenomenally. The stream should speak for itself with how things went down. Game 1 worked out fortunately in my favour. Game 2 went a bit more rocky for me, and Game 3 ended up working fortunately for me in the end.\nRegardless of the games, Sam played to his outs in every single game, and it definitely shows why he is one of the best players out there, especially this year, with his insane results at\nOCIC\nand\nPerth\nto say the least. Sam is also a great guy to talk to and be around whenever the opportunity is there.\nYou can watch my\nTop 4 match\nversus Galvin\nhere\n!\nAnd finally, you can watch my\nFinals match\nversus Sam\nhere\n!\nClosing words\nSince\nRegulation Set C\nwill be played all the way up until Worlds, I think it\u2019s important that whatever you\u2019re teambuilding with, you\u2019re having\nfun\nwith it. Take\nDaniel Walker\nfor example. He put a Scizor on his team, which I absolutely loved to see, and kept on telling him during our match how cool it was to see it! Another example is\nGalvin Hui\nand his Azumarill. That Azumarill was so uncharacteristic, but was such a momentous threat in the end. In reality, there is no right or wrong to teambuilding and getting ready for tournaments. The best piece of advice I would give for teambuilding in Regulation Set C and just teambuilding in general, is to\nstart small and build big\n.\nWhat I mean by this, is to start with 2 cool Pok\u00e9mon you like, or think are viable, and work around them. It could be Iron Hands and Bronzong, for example, and if your idea is to use Fake Out and set up Trick Room in some sort of way, start building around that idea, and adding Pok\u00e9mon to the team to help reinforce your idea. It\u2019s all about testing, experimenting, failing, and then redesigning to find success. And in a format like Regulation Set C, that demands the heavy use of\nTreasures of Ruin\n, really start to consider how you can use these Pok\u00e9mon to synergise and work well with your team. Think about how you\u2019re able to utilise the Abilities of these Pok\u00e9mon, and how they can work well with other members of your team. If you don\u2019t want to use the Treasures of Ruin, no worries at all, because you don\u2019t actually need to use one if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s just an option you have in case you decide you want to pursue it with an idea you might have in mind!\nOverall, I had an amazing time playing in this event.\nI was planning to retire soon from VGC\nas i\u2019m ready to close the chapter on this book and move on soon, and there\u2019s no better event to finish on a high, then my own local Regional event! I want to give an enormous shoutout to the entire\nAustralian VGC community\n. We\u2019re a very tight-knit community where everyone basically knows each other, or a friend of a friend at the very least. If you watched the stream, you would have seen the amazing commentary by\nPaul Amedee\n(\nMastodon\n) and\nHenry Rich\n(\nHobbit\n), who are not only talented at commentating, but are deeply rooted in the heart of the Australian VGC community, like many other Australians out there.\nI hope to attend Worlds\nthis year, and I will do my very best for the rest of this year!\nYou might also like...\nStream details and caster lineup for Bologna Special Event have been announced!\nThe last event of the season in Europe is streamed on 1\u20132 June, with Charlie Merriman, Jamie Boyt, Lee Provost and Markus Stadter as casters.\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez\n28 May, 2024\nDavid Rodr\u00edguez is the 2024 Mexico City Special Event Champion!\n2024 LAIC semifinalist David Rodr\u00edguez has won his fourth Special Event title!
