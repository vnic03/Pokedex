My name is\nFederico Camporesi\nand I recently got\nTop 4 at the\n2023 Pokemon World Championships\n, my best placement in an official tournament nowadays, also the reason why I\u2019m writing this.\nI started playing tournaments in\n2017\nin the Senior division, where I played until the circuit stopped in 2020 getting good results like 3 Regional wins and 2 International finals.\nBut I never cut worlds in that division, I had another attempt in Masters at the\n2022 World Championships\n, but I lost the win-and-in again.\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nBefore chosing my final team, I struggled a bit in my first prep phase, that started about 3 or 4 weeks before\nWorlds\n, also because of the\nnew ruleset\nthat didn\u2019t have any official tournament play yet. So I had to try every kind of team to understand what fits my playstyle better and which archetype was the strongest for Worlds in my opinion.\nI started my prep with a\nTailwind\nteam, that was the most popular archetype on the high ladder and also saw it doing well in many Japanese tournaments and in\nthe Malaga tournament\nwon by\nEric Rios\n. I stayed in the top ladder of showdown for a week, peaking at 1950, but every day I felt more that the team was a \u201cladder garbage\u201d and didn\u2019t feel good about it in best-of-3 sets, especially in a tournament like Worlds where you are most likely facing only very good players.\nIt was about one week before Worlds and I didn\u2019t have a team I was confident with, so I decided to try a new archetype. I decided to move to a\nTrick Room\narchetype, since I felt I wanted to have some kind of speed control on my team, regardless if it was Tailwind or Trick Room. I wanted to have a team that was not forced to have the Trick Room on the field to work, so I was looking into a fast and offensive core to pair with Ursaluna and Cresselia, the best Trick Room duo in the metagame.\nI found my solution so fast, by just playing some ladder games. I matched with a guy that ended up being\nNikolaj H\u00f8j Nielsen\n, who also got Top 8 at Worlds. He had 4 accounts over the 1900s on the ladder, and was playing the Trick Room duo alongside Speed-boosting Flutter Mane, Dragonite, Single Strike Style Urshifu and Iron Hands.\nIt was exactly what I was looking for, so I decided to copy the open teamsheet, change and improve what I didn\u2019t like about the original team and give\nthis team\na try in the\nESM Open\n, my last online tournament before worlds. I ended up\nwinning the tournament\n, so I kept the most of the sets I played in the tournament and brought the team to Worlds.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nUrsaluna\n@ Flame Orb\nAbility: Guts\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def\nBrave Nature\nIVs: 0 Spe\n\u2013 Earthquake\n\u2013 Facade\n\u2013 Swords Dance\n\u2013 Protect\nThe\nmain damage dealer\nof the team, also the main Trick Room abuser. I think Swords Dance and 0 Speed IVs is the best way to abuse the Trick Room. Also I just went for a 252 HP, 252+ Atk EV spread, since I think you need to have the max amount of available damage to abuse the advantage that a Trick Room gives. I just used 4 points on Defense to optimize the rolls of Urshifu\u2019s Wicked Blow and Surging Strikes.\nThe\nGhost\nTera Type is basically the best to avoid Fake Out that can stall the Trick Room turns otherwise, and is also good for Fighting-type moves, of course.\nDefensive calcs\n252\n+\nAtk Urshifu-Rapid Strike\nSurging Strikes\n(3 hits) vs. 252 HP / 4 Def Ursaluna on a critical hit: 204-252 (86 \u2013 106.3%) \u2014 approx. 12.5% chance to OHKO\n252\n+\nAtk Urshifu-Single Strike\nWicked Blow\nvs. 252 HP / 4 Def Tera-Ghost Ursaluna on a critical hit: 204-242 (86 \u2013 102.1%) \u2014 12.5% chance to OHKO\nCresselia\n@ Safety Goggles\nAbility: Levitate\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 252 HP / 156 Def / 100 SpD\nBold Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Lunar Blessing\n\u2013 Trick Room\n\u2013 Ally Switch\n\u2013 Moonblast\nCresselia is the\nmain support\nof the entire team, and of course the best partner for Ursaluna. I went for a spread that allowed me a balanced bulk in both defenses, something that allows Cresselia to set up Trick Room without being forced to Terastallize in most situations.\nI went for a\nWater\nTera Type despite the fact that most players were playing the Fairy Tera Type, since I liked to be allowed to use it in front of Chien-Pao + Rapid Strike Style Urshifu, Chi-Yu + Flutter Mane and Steel types like Gholdengo.\nI think Moonblast and Ally Switch is the best way to close the moveset, with the first move giving you a good coverage to hit some common Pok\u00e9mon despite the low Special Attack, while Ally Switch is so good with open teamsheets even when you don\u2019t want to click it, since it creates mindgames for your opponent. Also it\u2019s possible to use it to sometimes escape bad situations or to just try to get a better turn in some passive situations (for example, avoiding opposing Grimmsnarl\u2019s Parting Shots).\nOffensive calcs\n0 SpA Cresselia\nMoonblast\nvs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Urshifu-Single Strike: 172-204 (98.2 \u2013 116.5%) \u2014 87.5% chance to OHKO\n0 SpA Cresselia\nMoonblast\nvs. 0 HP / 4 SpD Chien-Pao: 80-96 (51.6 \u2013 61.9%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nDefensive calcs\n252\n+\nAtk\nBlack Glasses\nUrshifu-Single Strike\nWicked Blow\nvs. 252 HP / 156+ Def Cresselia on a critical hit: 188-224 (82.8 \u2013 98.6%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nSpA\nChoice Specs\nFlutter Mane\nShadow Ball\nvs. 252 HP / 100 SpD Cresselia: 182-216 (80.1 \u2013 95.1%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nIron Hands\n@ Assault Vest\nAbility: Quark Drive\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nWater\nEVs: 140 HP / 156 Atk / 4 Def / 204 SpD / 4 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Heavy Slam\n\u2013 Fake Out\n\u2013 Drain Punch\n\u2013 Wild Charge\nIron Hands is basically the\nmost solid Pok\u00e9mon\nin the metagame, and also the best way to connect a Trick Room core to an offensive one. It is a very good support to set up with Fake Out, and also abuses the Trick Room itself. That\u2019s why I went for a very offensive and slow spread, that also allows to win the most 1v1s with the other Iron Hands, that frequently are less physically bulky in order to have more Speed.\nI went for the\nWater\nTera Type for the same reasons as Cresselia. It is also one of the best defensive typings, and the team doesn\u2019t have problems with Amoonguss (which would be the only reason to run Grass over Water) thanks to the Safety Goggles Cresselia with Lunar Blessing.\nI don\u2019t have anything to say about the moves, which I think are basically the best four you can run.\nIron Hands ended up being the Pok\u00e9mon that I used the most times during Worlds, bringing it almost every battle when using both the Trick Room mode and the fast mode.\nOffensive calcs\n156+ Atk Iron Hands\nWild Charge\nvs. 4 HP / 0 Def Urshifu-Rapid Strike: 168-200 (95.4 \u2013 113.6%) \u2014 75% chance to OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n156\n+\nAtk Iron Hands\nDrain Punch\nvs. 140 HP / 4 Def Iron Hands: 66-78 (26.7 \u2013 31.5%) \u2014 guaranteed 4HKO (8,2% to 3HKO after a Fake Out)\n236\n+\nAtk\nMystic Water\nSword of Ruin\nTera-Water\nUrshifu-Rapid Strike\nSurging Strikes\n(3 hits) vs. 140 HP / 4 Def Iron Hands on a critical hit: 210-252 (85 \u2013 102%) \u2014 approx. 6.3% chance to OHKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nGuts\nUrsaluna\nEarthquake\nvs. 140 HP / 4 Def Iron Hands: 206-246 (83.4 \u2013 99.5%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n116\n+\nSpA\nProtosynthesis Tera-Fairy\nFlutter Mane\nMoonblast\nvs. 140 HP / 204 SpD Assault Vest Iron Hands: 204-244 (82.5 \u2013 98.7%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nFlutter Mane\n@ Booster Energy\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 116 HP / 60 Def / 196 SpA / 4 SpD / 132 Spe\nTimid Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Moonblast\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Icy Wind\n\u2013 Protect\nSpeed-boosting\nBooster Energy Flutter Mane with\nIcy Wind\nwas a very good way to make the fast core stronger with more speed control. The Speed was meant to outspeed Regieleki, the fastest Pok\u00e9mon of the ruleset, with the Booster Energy activated. It also allows to be always faster than the Adamant Chien-Pao and Modest Flutter Mane even when the boost isn\u2019t active. I decided to speed-creep this amount by 1 (189 instead of 188) since I thought it would have been a common Speed. I then went for a very high Special Attack, since I felt I needed to fix the lack of firepower due to not having an offense-boosting item. This ended in a spread with very low bulk that is still enough for some specific important calcs.\nDefensive calcs\n252\n+\nAtk Sword of Ruin Chien-Pao\nSucker Punch\nvs. 116 HP / 60 Def Flutter Mane: 120-142 (82.7 \u2013 97.9%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nMystic Water Sword of Ruin Tera-Water\nUrshifu-Rapid Strike\nAqua Jet\nvs. 116 HP / 60 Def Flutter Mane: 118-140 (81.3 \u2013 96.5%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nBlack Glasses\nUrshifu-Single Strike\nSucker Punch\nvs. 116 HP / 60 Def Flutter Mane: 115-136 (79.3 \u2013 93.7%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nUrshifu-Single-Strike\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Unseen Fist\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Wicked Blow\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Protect\nNothing special to say, Urshifu has the most broken ability of the game and it is\na must for every offensive core\n, since it pairs very well with the Speed-boosting Flutter Mane and Ursaluna. It fits perfectly in this team! The Dark type allows this Pok\u00e9mon to destroy every Ghost type, which also is a Tera Type commonly used against this team since it protects from Ursaluna\u2019s Facade and Iron Hands\u2019s Fake Out and Drain Punch.\nSince I had a free Focus Sash, I used it on this Pok\u00e9mon with a\nDark\nTera Type to just have a better Wicked Blow spam.\nDragonite\n@ Choice Band\nAbility: Inner Focus\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFlying\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Tera Blast\n\u2013 Ice Spinner\n\u2013 Extreme Speed\n\u2013 Stomping Tantrum\nThe\nexotic pick\nof this team. Dragonite used to have Normal Tera Type and not be that\nfast\nin most teams, also being played only alongside Chien-Pao. Its use dropped in the last period before Worlds.\nThis max Speed\nFlying\n-Tera Type Dragonite pairs very well with the Speed-boosting Flutter Mane, since they both are immune to Fake Out. Flutter Mane + Dragonite is a lead with a very high offensive pressure that can be deadly if your opponents don\u2019t read it well. Furthermore, many people didn\u2019t expect Dragonite to be that fast, with a Speed that allows it to be faster than almost every Pok\u00e9mon in the metagame after an Icy Wind. EV spreads are the only way to get a surprise effect by playing with open teamsheets, so a strange spread was something that was missing in the team.\nRegarding the moves, I chose Ice Spinner as the filler slot to get a good damage on Rillaboom without being forced to Terastallize, which also removes the Grassy Terrain that decreases the power of Ursaluna\u2019s Earthquake. It is also very good against Indeedee.\nHow to use the team\nI didn\u2019t have a lot of specific plans, also because of the very few time I had to prepare after I decided to use that team. I still had some standard leads for the games 1 of some matchups that I\u2019ll show you. The thing I liked the most about the team was the\npossibility to completely change your mode between games\n, so also the way the best-of-3 sets goes during game 1 influences the choices in games 2 and 3.\nMatch-ups\nTornadus hyper-offense\nTrick Room mirror\nJapanese goodstuffs (Zeen's)\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nMatch-ups\nClick on the tabs to see some notes!\nTornadus hyper-offense\nLead\n+\nBack\nand a filler\nThat lead is almost a must. You won\u2019t be able to set up the Trick Room every time because of Covert Cloak or Ghost-Tera Type Tornadus, but forcing the opponent to lead and Terastallize with it is a very good thing to manage the match in a better way. Cresselia can also be saved to set up a Trick Room in the late game or use Moonblast to deal high damage to many common Pok\u00e9mon that are used in the Tailwind archetypes, like Chien-Pao and Urshifu.\nTrick Room mirror\nLead\n+\nBack\nUrsaluna without Cresselia is fine in the mirror, since you have a higher firepower than your opponent. You can abuse the Trick Room if the opponent sets it up themselves, while if they don\u2019t you just have Dragonite and Urshifu, powerful and offensive Pok\u00e9mon outside of Trick Room.\nJapanese goodstuffs (Zeen's)\nLead\n+\n/\nBack\n,\n/\nThis is a very tricky match-up and depens on the plays turn by turn. The plan can be adapted in so many ways; the Flutter Mane + Dragonite mode is very good too, but you need to hard-read the opponent\u2019s lead.\nSo Cresselia + Iron Hands is the plan I went for in game 1 most times (you can always use the other mode as well). An Ursaluna lead is a good way to surprise the opponents sometimes, and to get a very tough offense faster, also being allowed to use Swords Dance if the opponent doesn\u2019t lead with Amoonguss. Never lead Ursaluna if the opponent has Taunt Urshifu, since you would need the Fake Out to set up Trick Room.\nIndeedee + Armarouge\nLead\n+\nBack\nNothing special to say, just spam attacks with the lead while also removing the terrain with Ice Spinner, then clean up with Ursaluna in the back. As I said before, I don\u2019t have any other specific plan, because of the few time I had to prepare and also the fact the team was based so much on adapting game by game, so I thought it was not important to flowchart everything.\nTournament run\nDay 1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nLauri Halonen\n(\nLatsu7\n)\nR2\nWW\nFrancesco Pero\n(\nCICCIOTT\n)\nR3\nWLW\nAdam Cherfaoui\n(\nShao\n)\nR4\nWLL\nFrancesco Iozzia\n(\nYoung Nova\n)\nR5\nWW\nAkatoki Sakamoto\n(\nsyaronalex\n)\nR6\nWW\nTang Shiliang\n(\n20\u4eae\u4eae\n)\nNotes\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nR6\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nLauri Halonen\n(\nLatsu7\n)\nI started the tournament facing Lauri. He is a good player, but this match was a pretty easy win, probably also because of the match-up being good for me.\nI didn\u2019t see so many ways for him to stop a well-placed Ursaluna or an offensive spam from Dragonite + Urshifu, so I won one game with each mode.\nR2\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR2\nWW\nFrancesco Pero\n(\nCICCIOTT\n)\nA good player and also a friend, I had to play an almost full mirror with Francesco, who had 5 out of the 6 same Pok\u00e9mon as me.\nI had a small advantage because of my Focus Sash Urshifu, while his had Black Glasses.\nI still had to make hard reads to win that match, and for example in game 1 I ended up winning by going for Wicked Blow with Urshifu predicting a Poison-Tera Type Terastallization on that turn.\nR3\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR3\nWLW\nAdam Cherfaoui\n(\nShao\n)\nAdam is one of the players that beat me the most times during the season, so I knew it was going to be a tough match.\nHis team was kind of strange and had the answers to mine. I managed to win the match at the third game by leading aggressively with Ursaluna + Cresselia, taking some risks.\nR4\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR4\nWLL\nFrancesco Iozzia\n(\nYoung Nova\n)\nI then faced my friend Francesco with a tough match-up. I was scared of Fairy-Tera Type Kingambit, since it counters most of my team. I still was able to win by playing very well with my Ursaluna Trick Room mode.\nI technically made it and won the set 2-0, but in this round my Ursaluna got removed from my team after the hack check, which also resulted in a game loss for the current match. Since I had to play the third game without Ursaluna, I just lost since I didn\u2019t have a win condition for that match-up.\nR5\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR5\nWW\nAkatoki Sakamoto\n(\nsyaronalex\n)\nI had to play without Ursaluna starting from this round. My opponent knew it and went for Iron Hands + Amoonguss lead in the first game, a lead that was very tough to face without the\nbear\n, but I luckily managed to win game 1 thanks to a double Protect in the late game. I then won game 2 by just spamming Moonblast and Tera Blast on the right slots with my Flutter Mane + Dragonite lead.\nR6\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR6\nWW\nTang Shiliang\n(\n20\u4eae\u4eae\n)\nI had my first win-and-in for the Day 2 against Shiliang, a very good player who also won a Regional this season. Luckily for me, the fact Shiliang had a double Intimidate on his team makes the missing of Ursaluna less important, since I probably would have played this match-up without it even if I was able to. I managed to win both games thanks to Cresselia paired with the offensive Pok\u00e9mon; it helped me contain the huge offense of Shiliang\u2019s team, and of course to set up the Trick Room and have an answer to the Tailwind.\nDay 2 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nLL\nMaurice Uteg\n(\nMiku\n)\nR2\nWLW\nMizuki Sasaki\n(\n\u3057\u3089\u305f\u307e\n)\nR3\nLWW\nBaris Akcos\n(\n>BillaVGC<\n)\nR4\nWW\nJiseok Lee\n(\n282\n)\nR5\nLWL\nShohei Kimura\n(\n\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\n)\nR6\nLWW\nRen Kotorii\n(\n\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\n)\nR7\nWW\nKyle Livinghouse\n(\nAnimus\n)\nNotes\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nR6\nR7\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nLL\nMaurice Uteg\n(\nMiku\n)\nIn the first round I faced Maurice.\u00a0He is a very good player and also has a team that can be very tough to face for my Ursaluna, thanks to Grimmsnarl + Intimidate. Maurice played very well, also some bad luck made things harder for me in both games, but I can\u2019t complain so much about this since my opponent didn\u2019t make mistakes. Also, I have been lucky enough with the match-ups in Day 1 after my Ursaluna got removed, so it\u2019s fine to start Day 2 in this way.\nR2\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR2\nWLW\nMizuki Sasaki\n(\n\u3057\u3089\u305f\u307e\n)\nI had a very tough match by playing against the most common Japanese goodstuffs, a team which also ended up winning the whole thing. Games always were very close, but I probably could have played so much better the one I lost, since I let my Ursaluna get a free Spore for my opponent and he managed to win by easily stalling my Trick Room. Luckily for me, I started playing well again in game 3 and I won it with the right reads.\nR3\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR3\nLWW\nBaris Akcos\n(\n>BillaVGC<\n)\nBaris had the craziest team of Worlds, and I was so confused in the first team preview. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I was not able to predict his choices at all, which ended up in getting destroyed in game 1. I immediately understood his gameplan and how the team works, so I managed to win the next two games and the set, but it was very tough overall.\nR4\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR4\nWW\nJiseok Lee\n(\n282\n)\nI then faced Jiseok, one of the best players in the world, in my opinion. He was playing Suica\u2019s team, but with a few changes. He didn\u2019t have a very solid way to avoid the Trick Room setup, so I went for it both games and won without too many problems. I still had to make some hard reads, but nothing incredible.\nR5\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR5\nLWL\nShohei Kimura\n(\n\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\n)\nAnd here we are! Of course nobody knew it at the moment of the match, but I had to play the World Champion Shohei. The set was very tough, but I also enjoyed it so much, and it had hard reads from both sides. Unluckily, I had some bad luck with rolls and sleep turns in both the games I lost, and of course it was enough to lose to a top player like Shohei.\nR6\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR6\nLWW\nRen Kotorii\n(\n\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\n)\nI then faced Ren, another player that got Top 8 at the\nJapan National\n. He was playing a very unusual team with Incarnate Forme Landorus. I lost game 1 by losing 2 out of 2 speed ties with my Urshifu against his, but he also played better in some turns. I then was lucky enough to win a game thanks to the speed ties as well, and outplayed him in the last one.\nR7\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR7\nWW\nKyle Livinghouse\n(\nAnimus\n)\nMy win-and-in was against Kyle\u00a0and he was playing one of the teams I lost to most times during my Worlds prep. But just thanks to those many losses I exactly knew what to do in that match-up, and the more experience with it probably is the reason why I got an easy win in game 1. The match was still open and Kyle adapted to my gameplan in a very good way in game 2 and was about to win, but I was very lucky and avoided a Leaf Storm from his Amoonguss to my Ursaluna. This won me the game and saved me from playing a third game, so I can\u2019t complain any more about the previous unlucky losses.\nTop Cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 26\nWW\nAnthony Liuzzo\n(\nGlum\n)\nTop 16\nWLW\nLuca Lussignoli\n(\nMOODY GIRL\n)\nTop 8\nWW\nAbdullah Mohayyuddin\n(\nsempra\n)\nTop 4\nLL\nMichael Kelsch\n(\nMichi\n)\nNotes\nTop 26\nTop 16\nTop 8\nTop 4\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nTop 26\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 26\nWW\nAnthony Liuzzo\n(\nGlum\n)\nI then had to win one last match to get to the Top 16, and it is against Anthony, who\u2019s playing a kind of strange team. The match-up was not hard for me and I easily won both games, since his team overall suffered so hard from Iron Hands + Single Strike Style Urshifu.\nTop 16\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 16\nWLW\nLuca Lussignoli\n(\nMOODY GIRL\n)\nAnother Italian match, Luca\u00a0was on fire this day and went safe directly to top 16 by going 7-0 in the Day 2 Swiss rounds. Also, I think his team was one of the best calls of this tournament.\nHe was able to put me in trouble thanks to his Ghost-Tera Type Pelipper with Wide Guard, which can make Ursaluna completely useless if paired well with Gholdengo. I still brought my Ursaluna in every game, since I needed to force him to do this, so that my Urshifu would have been able to get many kills against the Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon. I won game 1 thanks to that, but Luca understood very well my intentions and outplayed me in game 2.\nIn game 3, we got a disconnection that hit the entire top 16 table. It happened in a 3v2 position for me, which resulted in a tie and forced us to go to sudden death. The position was very tricky and it is impossible to define who was going to win if the game didn\u2019t crash. I then won the match in the sudden death by a very aggressive read, going for Stomping Tantrum + Wild Charge on Amoonguss, which switched on Gholdengo.\nTop 8\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWW\nAbdullah Mohayyuddin\n(\nsempra\n)\nAbdullah\u00a0is one of the best players in the world right now, but he was playing the exact 6 Pok\u00e9mon as Luca, so my top 16 was a very good prep match going into this one. Also, his sets were so much worse than Luca\u2019s ones, at least in the match-up against my team, especially since his Pelipper didn\u2019t have the Ghost Tera Type, and his Amoonguss didn\u2019t have a Sitrus Berry.\nKnowing this, I played this match in a very confident way since I just beat the strongest version of that match-up.

Unluckily for me, my match-up against Michael\u2019s team was almost impossible to win, and also I didn\u2019t have time to prepare this match after the Top 8, while Michael just beat my same team in his Top 8 match.\nThis ended up in being destroyed by him, who got a deserved Worlds final. This match was played in a side-stream.\nYou can watch my Top 4 set versus Michael\nhere\n!\nConclusion\nTo be honest I didn\u2019t expect to reach such a high placement. I probably would not have been able to reach it without\nIl Server\n, my best friends in the community and also the guys that help me prepare for major tournaments. I also have to thank\neverybody who supported me\nfrom home. Last but not least to all my\nother friends and family\nwho supported me like always.\nWith this placement, I\u2019m now\nalready qualified for the 2024 Worlds in Honolulu\n, so I may take a break from tournaments in the future.

My name is\nAnthony Liuzzo\n(better known as\nGlum\nin the VGC community), I\u2019m one of the\nWorld Cup\nmanagers from last year for\nTeam France\n, and today I\u2019m going to talk about the rough journey that led me to top cut the\nWorld Championships\n, starting all the way from Day 1.\nI started VGC tournaments in\n2017\nat local events. In 2019, after a messed-up 2018 season, I managed to qualify. After that, I took a hiatus until the\n2023 London Open\n. During this time, it was revealed that the World Championships would be held in Yokohama. Determined to participate, I committed myself to the endeavor. After a half-tone season, I successfully secured my qualification. Allow me to share the journey from my preparation leading up to the final outcome!\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nAt the beginning of the summer, I was really not confident in my capabilities to achieve anything in\nJapan\n. I went from a solid start of the season to an absolute nightmare to rack up the last points to qualify. To sum up, I was really not considering myself worthy of the event, so I decided that I had to put myself through a hyperbolic time-chamber kind of training, so I played a lot of games, mainly ladder games because I usually try to avoid this exercise.\nAnd after 3 weeks or so, I finally felt that I had improved, the problem now was to find a good team. I had one idea in mind at that moment : \u201cI want to play a hyper offensive team with\nFlutter Mane\nand\nTornadus\n\u201d.\nStarting from that point me and my friends\nAdam Cherfaoui\n(Shao) and\nNicolas Legoux\n(NewShiny) started to scratch to find something that could buff the tailwind core.\nThat was the final team of my friends, but I didn\u2019t really liked Iron Bundle in the format so I decided to keep trying to find something that would suit me better.\nAfter some ladder testing I eventually determined the optimal third slot for my team:\nSingle Strike Style Urshifu\n. The underlying strategy was straightforward: I aimed to eliminate threats after weakening them with chip damage from Dazzling Gleam, leveraging Urshifu\u2019s remarkable offensive capabilities combined with Unseen Fist. The Dark-type Urshifu proved more dependable in practice, especially due to the prevalence of Water-Tera Type slots and the challenge posed by Amoonguss, which either countered Rapid Strike Style Ushifu, or forced them to hold the Safety Goggles.\nAfter that I wasted a fair amount of time giving Gastrodon a chance to shine because in theory it was \u201cgood\u201d against Iron Hands, Dondozo, Heatran and Rapid Strike Style Urshifu, but in practice nothing good came from it, so I decided to move on. I saw\nEric Rios\n\u2018s\nteam\nand\nFarigiraf\ncaught my attention, so I\u00a0tried it.\nI liked the team but I knew something was still off\u2026 unfortunately I couldn\u2019t find what by myself.\nTwo weeks remained before the tournament and I was more confident that I had been in June, but still nowhere I wanted to be, so I decided to ask one of my homies,\nFlorian Henry\n(Shiyo), for some help (it was way more pathetic but let\u2019s embellish the situation) and then he gave me the slot I was lacking.\nHeatran\nwas a big tilt in my head, specifically Florian\u2019s set: max Speed, max Special Attack, Fairy Tera Type, simple task: in addition to Urshifu, it cleans the target that survives from the two main Pok\u00e9mon (mainly opposing Flutter Manes and many more under Sunny Day).\nAfter some practice with the team, I suggested him to switch Rillaboom for\nUrsaluna\n, but with a very specific Speed stat to fix some matchups and adding an additional sweep mode to the team.\nWe were\nall settled\n. The team was locked and it felt like it was built for me (first time in 6 years) and I was impatient to compete in Japan!\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nFlutter Mane\n@ Choice Specs\nAbility: Protosynthesis\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 116 HP / 76 Def / 164 SpA / 4 SpD / 148 Spe\nModest Nature\n\u2013 Moonblast\n\u2013 Shadow Ball\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Psyshock\nThe\nsuperstar\nof the 2023 season, and the main damage dealer of the team. Nothing really fancy about the set:\nFairy\nTera Type in combination of Protosynthesis boost and Choice Specs dealt INSANE damage.\nI tried to make it faster at the beginning, but the more I was practicing the more I saw Speed-boosting Booster Energy Flutter Mane, so I assumed that a more offensive and bulky set would give me the upper hand in most mirror situations.\nDefensive calcs\n252 Atk Sword of Ruin Chien-Pao\nIce Spinner\nvs. 116 HP / 76 Def Flutter Mane: 121-144 (83.4 \u2013 99.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nChoice Band\nDragonite\nAerial Ace\nvs. 116 HP / 76 Def Flutter Mane: 123-145 (84.8 \u2013 100%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nMystic Water Tera-Water\nUrshifu-Rapid Strike\nSurging Strikes\n(3 hits) vs. 116 HP / 76 Def Flutter Mane\nin Sun\non a critical hit: 120-144 (82.7 \u2013 99.3%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nHeatran\n@ Life Orb\nAbility: Flash Fire\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe\nModest Nature\n\u2013 Heat Wave\n\u2013 Flash Cannon\n\u2013 Earth Power\n\u2013 Protect\nThe\nglue that fixed a lot of match-ups\n. Heatran\u2019s typing combined with\nFairy\nTera Type is amazing, it automatically fixed my Chi-Yu matchup and it help deal with Urshifu in some situations.\nHeat Wave under Sun with the Life Orb boost deals ridiculous damage, and most of all Flash Cannon under Tailwind secured me a lot of Flutter Mane KOs in the late game. Earth Power benefits us in the mirror, since the opponent is virtually forced to Terastallize Heatran into Grass or Fairy (betting on being the fastest Heatran with our invest).\nOffensive calcs\n252\n+\nSpA\nLife Orb\nHeatran\nFlash Cannon\nvs. 116 HP / 4 SpD Flutter Mane: 151-182 (104.1 \u2013 125.5%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nUrshifu\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Unseen Fist\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Wicked Blow\n\u2013 Close Combat\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Detect\nMy\nsecond favorite\nPok\u00e9mon from the tournament. Almost always brought as the 4th slot in games, it finishes the job of the previous attacker like no one else and really simplifies any game state due to his absurd ability to hit through Protect.\nAdamant Nature is preferred since I run Focus Sash\u00a0and I have quite a few speed control solutions; we really wanted to maximize damage, and it also was often in 1v1 end-game situations which gave an Adamant Nature even more credit. I wanted to maximize damage so\nDark\nTera Type was obvious, and it comes up for some calcs with Farigiraf\u2019s Helping Hand.\nOffensive calcs\n252\n+\nAtk Urshifu-Single Strike\nWicked Blow\nvs. 116 HP / 76 Def Flutter Mane on a critical hit: 150-177 (103.4 \u2013 122%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nTera-Dark\nUrshifu-Single Strike\nHelping Hand Wicked Blow\nvs. 236 HP  / 156+ Def Amoonguss on a critical hit: 210-248 (95.8 \u2013 113.2%) \u2014 75% chance to OHKO\nTornadus\n@ Mental Herb\nAbility: Prankster\nLevel: 50\nShiny: Yes\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 252 HP / 156 Def / 4 SpA / 92 SpD / 4 Spe\nBold Nature\n\u2013 Bleakwind Storm\n\u2013 Sunny Day\n\u2013 Tailwind\n\u2013 Protect\nThe main character of the event and my\nstrongest soldier\nduring the run.\nTornadus does simple things: it uses Tailwind, mitigates damage from Rapid Strike Style Urshifu and Rain teams, boosts the damage of my Heatran and Flutter Mane, and has a nice coverage move to not be useless when it\u2019s done supporting.\nGhost\nTera Type and Mental Herb are once again here to ease my mind, as if I really want to click on a support move, no matter the disruption, I will be able to do so thanks to that combination.\nDefensive calcs\n252 Atk\nMystic Water Tera-Water\nUrshifu-Rapid Strike\nSurging Strikes\n(3 hits) vs. 252 HP / 156+ Def Tornadus on a critical hit: 156-186 (83.8 \u2013 100%) \u2014 approx. 6.3% chance to OHKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nChoice Band Sword of Ruin Tera-Normal\nDragonite\nExtreme Speed\nvs. 252 HP / 156+ Def Tornadus: 153-180 (82.2 \u2013 96.7%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nFarigiraf\n@ Safety Goggles\nAbility: Armor Tail\nLevel: 50\nShiny: Yes\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 164 HP / 164 Def / 180 SpD\nBold Nature\n\u2013 Imprison\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Trick Room\n\u2013 Helping Hand\nThe\nsecond support\nof the team, its purpose was to annoy priority users like\nPaoNite\n(Chien-Pao + Dragonite), imprisoning hard Trick Room teams, and against heavy Tailwind I could just go for Trick Room myself. Helping Hand was really nice in some setups where it messes with damage calcs.\nThe\nFairy\nTera Type was useful because of Single Strike Style Urshifu and Chien-Pao being quite common in the metagame.\nDefensive calcs\n116\n+\nSpA\nChoice Specs Tera-Fairy\nFlutter Mane\nMoonblast\nvs. 164 HP / 180 SpD Farigiraf: 178-210 (82.4 \u2013 97.2%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nUrsaluna\n@ Flame Orb\nAbility: Guts\nLevel: 50\nShiny: Yes\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 92 HP / 140 Atk / 164 Def / 4 SpD / 108 Spe\nImpish Nature\n\u2013 Facade\n\u2013 Earthquake\n\u2013 Swords Dance\n\u2013 Protect\nThe alternative path\n. I did not pick it very often, but it did what I asked it when needed.\nI used that Speed to outspeed Chi-Yu under Tailwind, and to outspeed most of those Pok\u00e9mon with a 50 base Speed (such as Kingambit or Iron Hands), so I could go for a Tailwind lead and then on the last turn I could set up Trick Room, for example. It was a deciding factor against Iron Hands too during the run, making room for outplay and cleaning after they wasted the Tera Type on Flutter Mane.\nWe decided to run a really bulky set because we wanted to be able to land a hit no matter the board state turn one (after burn damages) and Swords Dance was more than enough to compensate.\nOffensive calcs\n140\n+\nAtk Ursaluna\nEarthquake\nvs. 252 HP / 0 Def Chi-Yu: 164-194 (101.2 \u2013 119.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\nDefensive calcs\n252\n+\nAtk Urshifu-Single Strike\nClose Combat\nvs. 92 HP / 164+ Def Ursaluna: 170-204 (78.3 \u2013 94%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO after burn damage\n252\n+\nAtk\nSword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nIcicle Crash\nvs. 92 HP / 164+ Def Ursaluna: 152-180 (70 \u2013 82.9%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO after burn damage\nHow to use the team\nTo summarize, in most situations, if you can\u2019t spot any trouble leading\nFlutter Mane + Tornadus\nwith Heatran and Urshifu in the back, do so. You can also lead with Flutter Mane + Farigiraf and with Ursaluna in the back; Heatran + Tornadus\u2026 it really should come from the preview, so good luck figuring it out!\nTournament run\nDay 1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nRikuto Takemoto\n(\n\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\n)\nR2\nWW\nRiley Factura\n(\nRiley\n)\nR3\nW?W\nYuma Suzuki\n(\nNEO\n)\nR4\nWLL\nLuka Trejgut\n(\n\u00a3\n)\nR5\nWLL\nLuca Ceribelli\n(\nYume\n)\nR6\nWW\nPeng Chongjun\n(\n\u4f0a\u85e4\u5cfb\u5cfb\n)\nR7\nWW\nEzequiel Cordero\n(\nZekromZeke\n)\nNotes\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nR6\nR7\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWW\nRikuto Takemoto\n(\n\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\n)\nI didn\u2019t remember much of the game since I was really\ntired\n.

I won the first game using the plan established in practice by not clicking Tailwind turn one but rather boosting my Flutter Mane\u2019s damage with Sunny Day, in order to have two boosted Dazzling Gleams instead of one. In game 2, Riley adapted to this, but the result was the same and a critical hit from me locked a well-engaged game for me.\nR3\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR3\nW?W\nYuma Suzuki\n(\nNEO\n)\nIn Round 3 I faced Yuma,\n2022 Worlds\nsemifinalist in the\u00a0Senior division\n.

He then adapted really well for the second set by using his Fire-Tera Type Rillaboom. In the third game, I tried to mix up the turn 1 move. The game was really close and could have gone both ways but I was afraid of missing a Heat Wave, so I went for Flash Cannon, missing what would have been a KO, and Luka sealed the bag.\nR5\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR5\nWLL\nLuca Ceribelli\n(\nYume\n)\nI didn\u2019t have a great time during this round. The match-up was pretty tricky so I just tried my usual lead to gather information and adapt for the next games. I ended up winning game 1 with a big amount of critical hits from my Urshifu (not from Wicked Blow), a total steal. At the end of the game, before the second one started, Luca called a judge to tell that my Tornadus wasn\u2019t in the right form in the teamlist. I ended up having just a warning since the call was a bit late for a game loss. I know it is a competition and the mistake was mine, but\nI was really upset\n, and for the rest of the match I wasn\u2019t in the game, ended up losing game 3 on a 100% win position that I couldn\u2019t see because of my childish attitude. I was really frustrated because he played really well and I would have liked to play the game on normal circumstances, but mental strength is a part of the game and I lost in this round.\nLuca, if you read this report,\nI would like to apologize\nfor denying you a handshake at the end of the round. It\u2019s a competition and you did something that was in your right.\nAfter this round I mentally resetted quite easily thanks to my friends Shao and Nicolas, and I was not stressed at all about myself being one game away from being eliminated, I just wanted to face another good player.\nR6\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR6\nWW\nPeng Chongjun\n(\n\u4f0a\u85e4\u5cfb\u5cfb\n)\nAnother really good player, a Regional champion, and the first player to bring the famous\nRinya Sun\nteam from last season to success. Unfortunately for Chongjun, the match-up was\nheavily in my favor\nand I ended up winning easily. His Gholdengo getting KO\u2019d by Fairy-Tera Type Flutter Mane with just two Dazzling Gleams under the Sun was quite surprising, but that meant that he had no good switches into it.\nR7\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR7\nWW\nEzequiel Cordero\n(\nZekromZeke\n)\nThe\nwin and in\n.\nI tried to not think of it as a decisive game but more like a ladder game I wanted to win. The game was really close beside the score. Game 1 was a win thanks to a 50/50 situation I won (the fact that Rillaboom didn\u2019t have a Fire Tera Type helped my Flutter Mane). In the second game, Ezequiel managed to put himself in a good spot, but he was relying on Landorus\u2019s Rock Slides hitting both targets and picking up a KO, and it missed my Flutter Mane, so I instantly won the game and fell in tears.\nI did it\n! After a rough path and a lot of bad luck during the past season, I finally managed to reach Day 2 of the World Championships. I was over the moon at this moment, but little did I knew at this moment that I would do even better the next day.\nDay 2 Swiss rounds\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nLWL\nAaron Brok\n(\nAaron\n)\nR2\nWW\nKurt Wonka\n(\nLyon\n)\nR3\nWW\nYusuke Tsuganezawa\n(\n\u3048\u3071\n)\nR4\nWW\nJustin Burns\n(\nJustin\n)\nR5\nWLW\nNick Navarre\n(\nNails\n)\nR6\nLL\nEmilio Forbes\n(\nEmily\n)\nR7\nWLW\nAlister Sandover\n(\n\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\n)\nNotes\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nR6\nR7\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nLWL\nAaron Brok\n(\nAaron\n)\nIn game 1 I led with Farigiraf + Ursaluna into Chien-Pao + Iron Hands, but Farifarig was knocked out by a double focus. It was over from there. His Chien-Pao and Urshifu cleaned the game since I didn\u2019t have any speed control. I won game 2 by leading Flutter Mane + Tornadus and chipping the lead Chien-Pao + Iron Hands, to finish it off with Urshifu and Heatran in the back. I used the same lead in game 3, but he adapted with Amoonguss + Iron Hands, and I lost the mind game, losing to Fake Out + Spore.\nI was\nstill confident but not satisfied\nwith my set. Aaron played well and took risks when I was just accepting my fate. To sum up, I was playing too conservatively which isn\u2019t my style at all, so I decided to go all out for the next rounds!\nR2\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR2\nWW\nKurt Wonka\n(\nLyon\n)\nMy friends and I played screens a lot during\nRegulation Set C\n, and I grew quite the hate against Volcarona, so I was kind of\naware of what this team does\n.\nI won the first game by keeping the speed control in my favor and letting Urshifu take care of Volcarona. In game 2 I tried a different approach that almost cost me the game since he sacrificed both Grimmsnarl and Landorus to take out my Urshifu, but from that position I just spammed Bleakwind Storm (ended up having 2 speed drops on Volcarona) and won the game.\nR3\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR3\nWW\nYusuke Tsuganezawa\n(\n\u3048\u3071\n)\nI was pretty confident with the match-up, having\nSunny Day on Tornadus\nmade easier the game. I won both games by bringing Tornadus + Flutter Mane and Ursaluna in the back, because thanks to Tailwind and Sunny Day the only damaging option left was the Palafin, but with the bulk on my Ursaluna and the Sun it was not even a 3-hit KO.\nR4\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR4\nWW\nJustin Burns\n(\nJustin\n)\nA very good American player, but I had a really good match-up thanks to\nHeatran under Sun\nand the\npressure of Imprison\nin Farigiraf. I won both games thanks to the damage edge being in my favor.\nR5\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR5\nWLW\nNick Navarre\n(\nNails\n)\nAnother very good American player, I was spoiled and very happy about it. From game 1 I quickly realized the key of the match-up would be\nnot making him able to do everything with Baxcalibur and Klefki\n, so I had to force a Terastallization to let Heatran and Urshifu clean the path with Sun-boosted Heat Waves. Game 2 was really close, but I think he clutched it thanks to a read on a passive play from me. In game 3, I put myself in the winning position sooner. A critical hit on Stomping Tantrum killing my Flutter Mane gave me chills, but it was not important since the damage was already dealt and I was on the winning spot from there.\nR6\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR6\nLL\nEmilio Forbes\n(\nEmily\n)\nI don\u2019t know where to start. He is\nprobably the best player I have ever faced\nin my life, he folded me. Brambleghast was horrible against my composition, but I still had some hope because of Urshifu. Little did I know that it got 2-hit-KO\u2019d by Ghost-Tera Type Brambleghast. Even being extremely lucky in game 1 didn\u2019t help me win since almost all of my damaging moves were useless against Brambleghast, who kept putting holes in my team.\nI really thought he was going to win the whole tournament, but I needed to focus on the prize on the line. At this moment I forgot that I was\njust one game away from top cutting\nthe most important event of the season, I just wanted to face good opponents over and over.\nR7\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR7\nWLW\nAlister Sandover\n(\n\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\n)\nThe worst possible outcome,\nfacing one of my long-time Pok\u00e9mon friends\n, the man that picked me in\nNPA\nsome years ago and with whom I built amazing memories in the game and outside of it. But there is no friend during a competition, so I just zoned in again as if I was playing a high-ladder game.\nIn game 1, I tried to use my Flutter Mane against Iron Hands in the lead just to chip it to see if my Urshifu theory was correct, and it was because after the damage from Flutter Mane, my Dark-Tera Type Urshifu took care of it and I ended up winning the game from there.\nIn game 2, I got folded since he played very well with Yawn.\nIn game 3, I decided to play very aggressively from the lead, and it worked quite well until I realized when I clicked Bleakwind Storm on the Flutter Mane and Dondozo (his last 2 Pok\u00e9mon) that I would have to win a 50/50 to not lose the game on the spot, since my Tornadus would fall asleep at the end of the turn. In case he set up a Substitute and I hit it with Heatran, then Dondozo targeting Heatran would mean I\u2019d lose on the spot. I hit the Bleakwind Storm and got a speed drop, which basically turned the tables; he now was in the losing position, since he couldn\u2019t win with my Heatran around. I targeted the Flutter Mane, which got KO\u2019d. My Tornadus took its guaranteed sleep turn. Dondozo took a lot of recoil damage from using Wave Crash on my Heatran, making it faint from another use of the move or a Bleakwind Storm\u2026 but my Tornadus really wanted to show off, and it woke up and connected the move allowing me to accomplish my goal,\ntop cutting the World Championships\n.\nI jumped on the French crew, who were watching the game from behind (which almost got me another warning). It was amazing, everyone was so happy and hyped about the run. I will cherish this moment forever, it happened at the best possible moment and in Japan, where it all started.\nTop Cut\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 26\nLL\nFederico Camporesi\n(\nFedeCampo\n)\nFederico is a good player, a lot of my friends faced him this season and I was the last to not have faced him yet.\nThe matchup was not good, but it was alright. In game 1 I think I put myself in a decent position early, but I critted his Ursaluna and realized I would get folded by the free switch of Urshifu since in the process I sacrificed Flutter Mane. In game 2 I tried to defeat Cresselia during turn 1 without wasting the Terastallization, pressing Sunny Day, and I barely missed the KO with my Flutter Mane, and now my plan to avoid getting crept by Lunar Dance was over. I ended up losing some turns later to Iron Hands, who survived a Fairy Tera Type-boosted Dazzling Gleam from Farigiraf despite being at very low health. After the match, I read\nhis report\nand I saw it was heavily invested in Special Deffense, and I had 0 chances to KO it; information that maybe could have helped me.\nCongrats\nto him on the run! He is\nsuch a good player\n!\nConclusion\nAnd this is how I became the\nsecond French player in the Masters division\never to cut the World Championships.\nFor the first time going to an event, I didn\u2019t think about what placement I wanted to achieve. I didn\u2019t have a goal, I just went to the event thinking \u201cI want to play better than everyone in the venue\u201d. That was far from being the case, but it was\nmentally really better\nthan being obsessed with the placement as I used to be.\nI want to take some time to specifically thank some people now because without them I simply couldn\u2019t have played the event:\nSailordut\n,\nXVR_18\n,\nAur\u00e9lien Le Fur\n(MarioReL),\nFranck Bourachon\n(Opalko).

I am\nMichael Kelsch\n, also known as\nMichaelderBeste\n, and am the\nfinalist\nof the\n2023 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships\nin Yokohama.\nAs some of you already know, I started playing VGC in\nDecember 2022\n. The reason I started playing was to meet online friends in the\nBochum Regional\nin February 2023. This was the very first event I participated in and I immediately fell in love with the game and event overall. I got to\nTop 8\nand was able to meet a lot of people I wanted to meet. That\u2019s why I decided to go to other events too, such as\nUtrecht Special Event\n,\nEUIC\nin London and\nMalm\u00f6 Regional.\nAt first I couldn\u2019t really afford the trip to Yokohama because I am in the 2nd year in college, but my friends and family encouraged me to do it and helped me out wherever they could. I am so happy I took the opportunity to go to Japan and\nshow what newer players can be made of\n.\nTable of Contents\nTeambuilding process\nSix weeks before the World Championships would start, there was another big tournament, the\nNorth American International Championship (NAIC)\nin Columbus, OH, United States.\n\u00c0lex G\u00f3mez\nwas able to win the tournament with a very strong core of\nChien-Pao\nand\nDragapult\n.\nI always wanted to play Ghost-Tera Type Dragapult since\nJustin Tang\nwon the\nFort Wayne Regional\nback in April. So, after Dragapult and Chien-Pao had a huge success in\nRegulation Set C\n, I made the call to master a team around that core.\nI tested different versions in the big grassroots to make sure that I can go into my biggest tournament with no regrets.\nI added\nHeatran\nto the team because I had a huge success with another team I made in\nRegulation Set D\nbefore the ruleset was officially released.\nAfter realizing that Chien-Pao is very strong in the format, I decided to add the star in my team,\nFarigiraf\n, to be able to deny Sucker Punch for Dragapult. It also helps against other priorities like Fake Out or Extreme Speed which is obviously super useful. Farigiraf also provides a Trick Room mode and in the same time can deny the Trick Room with Imprison.\nIt was a perfect fit.\nI really wanted a Spore immunity and Fake Out in one slot. I first had Safety Goggles Iron Hands on the team, but I\nquickly realized that\nRillaboom\nfelt better on my team, so I decided to pick the Galarian starter.\nThe final slot was a\nFlutter Mane\nfor a very long time. You cannot go wrong with adding Flutter Mane on your team. Funnily enough, Flutter Mane was the Pok\u00e9mon I brought the least to the practice tournaments.\nI looked into alternatives and saw\nRapid Strike Style Urshifu\n. It also synergizes very well with Chien-Pao, so I tried it and it felt very good.\nThe team was\nfinished\n, three weeks before the tournament even started. I didn\u2019t make any changes since\nthen and I am very happy I approached the whole teambuilding process the way I did.\nThe Team\nGet the team\u2019s paste\nhere\n!\nDragapult\n@ Choice Band\nAbility: Clear Body\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGhost\nEVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe\nJolly Nature\n\u2013 Dragon Darts\n\u2013 Phantom Force\n\u2013 Tera Blast\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\nAs I said earlier, I was super excited to try out\nDragapult\nand the damage output it deals still blows my mind. Because it is often paired with Chien-Pao, the damage can be super devastating. Clear Body is such a good ability because you don\u2019t get any stat drops from Icy Wind, Charm or Intimidate.\nDragapult has\nthree very powerful STAB moves\nwith Phantom Force, Tera Blast and Dragon Darts. Dragon Darts especially is such a great move with its smart targetting and Phantom Force breaking Protects is also super helpful. The last move can be either Sucker Punch or U-Turn. I decided to play Sucker Punch since I don\u2019t have any form of speed control besides Trick Room on Farigiraf, so having another priority just felt very good.\nThe surprise I mentioned in my interview before the Finals against\nShohei Kimura\nwas the\nPP of Sucker Punch\n. I played exactly\n6 PP\non my Dragapult throughout the entire tournament and I had a specific reason for that. When a Pok\u00e9mon wants to stall out Sucker Punch because they are in range of it otherwise, it might spam Protect. The opponent can count the uses of Sucker Punch and then attack in the 9th turn. If a Protect fails in the 7th turn though, I would be able to get off two Choice Band Struggles to KO the opposing Pok\u00e9mon. You can beat a 1 HP Chien-Pao with this technique as well. When this thought crossed my mind, I decided to add this little gimmick. I can\u2019t put the damage output from Dragapult into words, so just look at the calcs below and make a picture yourself.\nOffensive calcs\n252 Atk Choice Band\nSword of Ruin\nTera-Ghost\nDragapult\nTera Blast\nvs. 0 HP / 0 Def Urshifu-Rapid Strike: 172-204 (98.2 \u2013 116.5%) \u2014 87.5% chance to OHKO\n252 Atk Choice Band\nSword of Ruin\nTera-Ghost\nDragapult\nPhantom Force\nvs. 228 HP / 156\n+\nDef Amoonguss: 192-228 (88 \u2013 104.5%) \u2014 31.3% chance to OHKO\n252 Atk Choice Band\nTera-Ghost\nDragapult\nTera Blast\nvs. 100 HP / 252 Def Tera-Fairy Flutter Mane: 146-172 (102 \u2013 120.2%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252 Atk Choice Band\nSword of Ruin\nTera-Ghost\nDragapult\nPhantom Force\nvs. 148 HP / 100 Def Tera-Water Gholdengo: 182-216 (100.5 \u2013 119.3%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252 Atk Choice Band\nSword of Ruin\nTera-Ghost\nDragapult\nPhantom Force\nvs. 108 HP / 4 Def Iron Hands: 180-214 (74 \u2013 88%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nChien-Pao\n@ Focus Sash\nAbility: Sword of Ruin\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nDark\nEVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe\nAdamant Nature\n\u2013 Icicle Crash\n\u2013 Crunch\n\u2013 Sucker Punch\n\u2013 Protect\nChien-Pao\nwas a very important Pok\u00e9mon on the team because, with its ability Sword of Ruin, it provides a huge damage boost to partners like Dragapult or Urshifu. I decided to run Adamant Chien-Pao with a\nDark\nTera Type to be able to maximize the damage output from Sucker Punch. The common Tera Type choice is Ghost to block Fake Out or Extreme Speed, but since I have a Farigiraf on my team I didn\u2019t need it.\nCrunch\nwas very useful to pressure Water-Tera Type Amoonguss, Indeedee and Cresselia. It also helps against Gholdengo, which can otherwise setup on you since Sucker Punch won\u2019t have an effect on Nasty Plot. I decided to play\nIcicle Crash\nover Ice Spinner to avoid contact against Rocky Helmet Pok\u00e9mon. It would also destroy my own Grassy Terrain. Together with an\nAdamant\nNature, I am able to OHKO almost every Flutter Mane: Icicle Crash for Fairy-Tera Type Flutter Mane and Crunch or Sucker Punch for Water-Tera Type ones.\nFunnily enough, the\n4 remaining EVs\nshould be always put into Defense because then a Choice Scarf Adamant Urshifu\u2019s Surging Strikes never OHKOs, and if the Urshifu is the Mystic Water Jolly variant, the roll also drastically changes from a 81% roll to OHKO to a 25% roll.\nOffensive calcs\n252+ Atk\nSword of Ruin\nTera-Dark\nChien-Pao\nSucker Punch\nvs. 116 HP / 124 Def Flutter Mane: 146-174 (100.6 \u2013 120%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n(Flutter Mane invested to withstand a Jolly Chien-Pao\u2019s Icicle Crash)\n252+ Atk\nSword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nIcicle Crash\nvs. 228 HP / 156\n+\nDef Amoonguss: 200-236 (91.7 \u2013 108.2%) \u2014 50% chance to OHKO\n252+ Atk\nSword of Ruin\nTera-Dark\nChien-Pao\nCrunch\nvs. 252 HP / 180 Def Cresselia: 200-236 (88.1 \u2013 103.9%) \u2014 25% chance to OHKO\n252+ Atk\nSword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nCrunch\nvs. 252 HP / 252\n+\nDef Indeedee-F: 180-212 (101.6 \u2013 119.7%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ Atk\nSword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nIcicle Crash\nvs. 252 HP / 4 Def Rillaboom: 218-260 (105.3 \u2013 125.6%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n252+ Atk\nSword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nIcicle Crash\nvs. 252 HP / 252\n+\nDef Tornadus: 182-216 (97.8 \u2013 116.1%) \u2014 87.5% chance to OHKO\nHeatran\n@ Assault Vest\nAbility: Flash Fire\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nGrass\nEVs: 244 HP / 4 Def / 236 SpA / 12 SpD / 12 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Heat Wave\n\u2013 Flash Cannon\n\u2013 Earth Power\n\u2013 Tera Blast\nThe next slot in the team is\nHeatran\n. I recommend to play 0 Attack IVs on Heatran to reduce Foul Play and confusion self-hit damage, but I played 13 IVs in the tournament because I had no time to catch a 0 IV one.\nHeatran with an\nAssault Vest\nis very good into the offensive special core of Chi-Yu paired with Flutter Mane. Assault Vest also gave me the option to run all 4 coverage moves on Heatran. This is very good because there is no switching into all of these moves. I decided to almost max out the Special Attack because you can get some really sick calcs with it, shown below.\nDefensive calcs\n252\n+\nSpA\nBeads of Ruin\nChi-Yu\nDark Pulse\nvs. 244 HP / 12 SpD Assault Vest Heatran: 66-78 (33.5 \u2013 39.5%) \u2014 guaranteed 3HKO\n252\n+\nSpA\nChoice Specs\nBeads of Ruin\nFlutter Mane\nShadow Ball\nvs. 244 HP / 12 SpD Assault Vest Heatran: 97-115 (49.2 \u2013 58.3%) \u2014 98% chance to 2HKO\n252 Atk\nSword of Ruin\nChien-Pao\nIce Spinner\nvs. 244 HP / 4 Def\nTera-Grass\nHeatran: 164-194 (83.2 \u2013 98.4%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\n252\n+\nAtk\nLife Orb\nSword of Ruin\nTera-Water\nBasculegion\nWave Crash\nvs. 244 HP / 4 Def\nTera-Grass\nHeatran\nin Rain\n: 169-199 (85.7 \u2013 101%) \u2014 6.3% chance to OHKO\nOffensive calcs\n236+ SpA\nTera-Grass\nHeatran\nTera Blast\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Tera-Water Basculegion: 188-224 (95.9 \u2013 114.2%) \u2014 81.3% chance to OHKO\n236+ SpA\nTera-Grass\nHeatran\nEarth Power\nvs. 252 HP / 0 SpD Heatran: 216-256 (109 \u2013 129.2%) \u2014 guaranteed OHKO\n236+ SpA\nTera-Grass\nHeatran\nTera Blast\nvs. 236 HP / 116 SpD\nTera-Water\nAmoonguss\nin Grassy Terrain\n: 204-240 (93.1 \u2013 109.5%) \u2014 50% chance to OHKO\n236+ SpA Heatran\nHeat Wave\nvs. 4 HP / 0 SpD Tornadus: 79-94 (50.9 \u2013 60.6%) \u2014 guaranteed 2HKO\nFarigiraf\n@ Rocky Helmet\nAbility: Armor Tail\nLevel: 50\nTera Type:\nFairy\nEVs: 252 HP / 236 Def / 4 SpA / 4 SpD / 12 Spe\nModest Nature\nIVs: 0 Atk\n\u2013 Psychic\n\u2013 Dazzling Gleam\n\u2013 Trick Room\n\u2013 Imprison\nNext, we have\nmy favourite on the team, Farigiraf.\nWith its Ability\nArmor Tail\n, it is able to prevent priority attacks for the own side. This helps a lot against Chien-Pao, Dragonite and Urshifu. I chose\nFairy\nas my Tera Type to resist Dark- and Fighting-type moves and have a Dragon-type immunity for Outrage Dragonite especially, since I have no other Fairy types on my team.\nFairy Tera Type pairs well with\nDazzling Gleam\n. Dazzling Gleam is also useful to get the KO on Chien-Pao after a Dragon Darts hit.\nPsychic\nwas the other attacking move to kill most Rapid Strike Style Urshifu variants. It is also the strongest move into Ursaluna and Amoonguss. Speaking of Ursaluna, I expected many people to run the combination of Ursaluna and Cresselia. That\u2019s why I decided to put\nImprison\non my Farigiraf. It also makes the almost unwinnable\nhard Trick Room\nmatchup super winnable. Another neat interaction is that you can block Flutter Mane using Dazzling Gleam, which also won me some games.\nIn general, Farigiraf was the\nmain option against teams with speed control\n. Against Tailwind teams, I set up the Trick Room myself, and against Trick Room teams, I deny it with Imprison.

Rillaboom works very well on my team because\nFake Out\npairs incredibly well with Phantom Force Dragapult. The Grassy Terrain also helps Heatran a lot. I added\nStomping Tantrum\nnext to the strongest STAB Rillaboom has,\nWood Hammer\n. Stomping Tantrum is good to pressure Fire, Poison and Steel types like Gholdengo or Heatran.\nSince my Heatran already had the Assault Vest, I had to figure out another item choice on Rillaboom.\nSitrus Berry\nwas a great option because it gives Rillaboom a bit more longevity, especially with the recoil of Wood Hammer. The last move of choice is Protect because all the other options were not needed and having a second Pok\u00e9mon with Protect is very good to stall out Tailwind or create mind games.\nIn hindsight\nWater\nTera Type\nmight have been a bit better\n, but\nPoison\nTera Type works great against Iron Hands and Flutter Mane as well.

It forms a very good offensive core with Dragapult and Chien-Pao and also helps a lot in Tailwind and Dondozo match-ups.\nWith\nChoice Scarf\nand U-Turn, you can lead Urshifu + Dragapult and still get the damage boost with Sword of Ruin for Dragapult after the U-Turn into Chien-Pao.

Dragapult is still able to deal a lot of damage but it gets a bit harder. In this match-up you have to play clever with Phantom Force Dragapult and bring in Rillaboom to Fake Out Amoonguss or use Chien-Pao to maximize Dragapult\u2019s damage.\nDondozo teams\nLead\n+\nBack\nAgainst Dondozo teams,\nDragapult\nis able to deal a lot of damage in the beginning. When Tatsugiri hits the field, you should position yourself to\nget Chien-Pao and Rillaboom on the field\n. Dondozo is not able to kill either of them and has to take a big Wood Hammer instead. If it decides to Terastallize into a Grass type, Icicle Crash deals a lot of damage and you should be able to clean the endgame with Urshifu.\nTournament run\nDay 1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWTW\nKotaro Okada\n(\n\u305b\u3080\u3079\u308b\n)\nR2\nWLW\nEnrique\u00a0Grimaldo\n(\nEGrim\n)\nR3\nWLW\nBhushan\u00a0Thumsi\n(\nFreezai\n)\nR4\nWLW\nRyoma\nOkamoto\n(\n\u307e\u3072\u308b\n)\nR5\nLWW\nTaro\nOkada\n(\n\u3055\u306a\u307f\n)\nNotes\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nNotes\nClick on the tabs to see some notes about my matches!\nR1\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR1\nWTW\nKotaro Okada\n(\n\u305b\u3080\u3079\u308b\n)\nMy first opponent had a very interesting team with\nGalarian Z\napdos\nand\nGarchomp\n. Before the start of game 1, I felt so insecure because I needed to know how much damage Zapdos deals to my Terastallize Urshifu with Chien-Pao on the field. These are a lot of modifiers but I knew that it would come down to that sooner or later.\nAfter a good game 1 from my side, we had a disconnect in game 2. He was probably winning the game but we can\u2019t say for sure, it was counted as a tie. The third game was super close because I survived two attacks barely. Farigiraf ate the Crunch from Chien-Pao with 3 HP left, which was the highest roll possible, but I still got a heart attack back then, and then the moment happened. My Urshifu, which is Terastallized, has to take Zapdos\u2019s Brave Bird. The problem is that it also got Rocky Helmet chip from the Maushold before. The Brave Bird targetted Urshifu and\u2026 it survived with 4 HP and I win the game.\nIt was a\nvery nervewracking\nRound 1 and\nI finally realized where I was\n, the Pok\u00e9mon Worlds Championship in Yokohama.\nR2\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR2\nWLW\nEnrique\u00a0Grimaldo\n(\nEGrim\n)\nNext round I faced a\nDondozo\n, which is not the best match-up for me. To make things worse, my opponent also has\nscreens\nto make it even tougher for me.\nIn game 1, I was able to defeat the Grimmsnarl in turn 1 with a Fake Out + Flash Cannon combo from Rillaboom + Heatran. I won the game. In game 2, he made a smart play by using the Terastallization on Grimmsnarl to get the screens up. I was not able to win the game. In the third game, I decided to go for Icicle Crash with my Chien-Pao. Crunch doesn\u2019t deal a lot of damage against +2 Dondozo behind a Reflect. I used Icicle Crash 6 times, missed once and got one flinch. I tried to maximize the Chien-Pao value by going for the flinch and I was able to get a second Wood Hammer off with Rillaboom finishing the Dondozo and, with that, the game.\nAgain, a\nvery tight\nseries but\nanother win\nin my pocket.\nR3\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nR3\nWLW\nBhushan\u00a0Thumsi\n(\nFreezai\n)\nIn round 3 I faced a friend I hang out with days before the tournament.

This time he had another trick on his sleeve,\nAbomasnow\n.\nI lost game 1 because Abomasnow, thanks to its Sitrus Berry, was able to live a combination of Ghost-type Tera Blast from Dragapult + Icicle Crash from Chien-Pao. In game 2, I decided to lead with the same two, so did he. This time I targeted the Iron Hands and it dropped to the aforementioned combination. He got Trick Room up, but I was able to stall it out and win the game. Game 3 I predicted him to lead with Cresselia, so I led with Farigiraf; he indeed led Cresselia.

I was able to defeat Flutter Mane with a Surging Strikes and get a lot of damage on the Amoonguss. My Heatran had to take the Spore. He sent in his Single Strike Style Urshifu. I decided to switch out Heatran to Chien-Pao and Terastallize my Urshifu as well to OHKO the Urshifu and seal the game. Game 2 I started a bit different. I realized that his team really struggled against Heatran. Especially if I didn\u2019t target the Talonflame, it was not able to touch Grass-Tera Type Heatran once Farigiraf hit the field.

I switched my Chien-Pao, so did he and my Urshifu was not able to pick a KO and fainted to the Outrage in return. In the third game, we had a game-deciding 50/50. His Dragonite just entered the field and I had my Heatran and Dragapult on the field. The Dragapult was locked into Phantom Force and I hadn\u2019t used my Terastallization yet. I decided not to Terastallize and he clicked Outrage, hitting into nothing cause it targetted the invisible Dragapult. Even if it hit Heatran, I would have won the game.\nIt was a great set against an insanely good player.

It was a very nice atmosphere though, we laughed with each other and even talked during the game.

In game 2 I tried to make a crazy read against his Chi-Yu and Tornadus. I clicked Grass-type Tera Blast with my Heatran and he switched the Chi-Yu into Urshifu. Sadly, I predicted the other slot to switch into Urshifu, so my predict didn\u2019t work out. I then used Heat Wave into his incoming Brambleghast, losing the game. I made a huge misplay in the first game because I thought I couldn\u2019t defeat the opposing Chi-Yu with Aqua Jet at 40% as he had Sunny Day on his Tornadus. That\u2019s why I also didn\u2019t want to lead Farigiraf which I usually do against Tailwind teams, because he could just use Sunny Day + Overheat into the Farigiraf.\nAfter the set, Emilio told me he didn\u2019t have Sunny Day. I was so upset and frustrated with myself because I\ndidn\u2019t read his teamsheet correctly\n.

I switched my Rillaboom into Heatran and used Trick Room, without using my Terastallization. It worked out, he switched out his Urshifu and I got the board I wanted to create and won the game without any trouble. In the second game, I used Fake Out on the Urshifu and this time he stayed in, using his Terastallization. The next turn he switched the other slot into Landorus to get an Intimidate off, but Wood Hammer was still able to KO after the Dazzling Gleam chip.\nI won the game again and\nsecured my spot in the top cut\n.

I knew I would face either\nJoseph Ugarte\nor Kenji, so I tried to prep a bit during my break. Kenji won the game, so I had to face a very interesting team around Zapdos and Magma Storm Heatran.\nIn the first Game, Dragapult was able to break huge holes into his team, granting me the first win. The second game took a while and, with a Pok\u00e9mon count of 3 vs 4, the game disconnected. Despite having fewer Pok\u00e9mon, I was still in the lead, according to Kenji. The game counted as a tie and we went on to the third game. I predicted him to bring Choice Scarf Gholdengo to deal with Dragapult and used Heatran to counter it. He missed two Magma Storms on my Dark-Tera Type Chien-Pao in game 2, but this time I got pretty unlucky. My Heatran got confused by Hurricane and hit itself 3 turns in a row, losing me the game. After all what happened in games 2 and 3, I still tried to keep my head up and go into my first-ever\nsudden death\nmatch.\nQuickly explained, the player who has more Pok\u00e9mon on the field at the end of a turn wins the game. Since my team is very offensive, I thought I had a good match-up going into the game, leading Urshifu + Chien-Pao against his Gholdengo + Urshifu lead. I made a very big mistake in turn 1. I could just Surging Strikes + Icicle Crash the Gholdengo slot and get a kill. I was thinking that his Gholdengo was faster though, hence I Terastallized and used Sucker Punch + Aqua Jet into the Gholdengo slot to make sure I got the KO against it. He switched the Gholdengo into Amoonguss and got a huge Surging Strikes off against my Chien-Pao. I couldn\u2019t switch into Heatran and I was locked to Heat Wave, without Terastallization available. In the next turn, I switched Chien-Pao to Rillaboom while he Terastallized Amoonguss and clicked Rage Powder to get a safe Swords Dance off with his Urshifu. My Aqua Jet barely tickled the Amoonguss. I knew it would be game if he had Zapdos in the back, because he could switch Amoonguss to Zapdos and use Protect with Urshifu. I used Aqua Jet + Wood Hammer on Urshifu and just hoped that it didn\u2019t used Protect with it. He switched his Amoonguss as expected, but surprisingly Heatran came in and his Urshifu used Surging Strikes on my Urshifu, so Rillaboom was able to get the KO.\nThis was\nthe most stressful game I had on the entire weekend\nand I was so incredibly happy to pull another win off.\nTop 8\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 8\nWW\nNikolaj\u00a0H\u00f8j Nielsen\n(\nNikolaj_H\n)\nMy next opponent was Nikolaj.

He had a very strong team with\na fast and a slow Trick Room mode\nat the same time.\nI decided to lead with Urshifu + Farigiraf with Chien-Pao and Dragapult in the back. My spread on Urshifu was key because I knew that the Flutter Mane couldn\u2019t KO my Terastallized Urshifu without a crit. I took advantage of that and won the first game because Dragapult was pressuring his Iron Hands in the end. In game 2, I decided to switch Dragapult for Rillaboom to be more secure against the Single Strike Style Urshifu. Once again, Urshifu was able to kill the Flutter Mane. I was thinking to target the Dragonite and switch Farigiraf to Chien-Pao to OHKO the Dragonite, which was going to Terastallize. I didn\u2019t go that route because I had a Chien-Pao in the back and assumed Flutter Mane to be a bigger problem than the Dragonite. Using Rillaboom was key because, this time, the last Pok\u00e9mon was the Urshifu, so I was able to win the set 2-0 and\ngo on to the semifinals\n.\nTop 4\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nTop 4\nWW\nFederico Camporesi\n(\nFedeCampoVGC\n)\nIt was time for my first stream match. I had to play against Federico, another European. I didn\u2019t go on stream though, because it was very late already and Federico had just been on stream, so I had to play on the\nside stream\ninstead. You can find the video\nhere\n.\nHe had the same team as my Top 8 opponent, which was very convenient to me. Nikolaj never brought Ursaluna or Cresselia against me, so did Federico. I did the same thing again by leading Urshifu + Farigiraf and OHKOing the Flutter Mane turn 1. In the end of game 1, I had to win a 50/50. Do I double Sucker Punch the Flutter Mane, or do I use Sucker Punch on Iron Hands + Icicle Crash on Flutter Mane? I did the latter one and he stayed in with his Iron Hands, so I won game one. This is a good example where Sucker Punch Dragapult comes in handy. Game 2 was nothing spectacular, Urshifu and Farigiraf did what they had to and Chien-Pao cleaned the game.\nI have to admit that I had a very good match-up against the team, and facing it back to back was lucky, but here I was,\nI reached the finals\n.\nFinals\nRound\nResult\nOpponent\nOpponent\u2019s team\nList\nFinals\nLL\nShohei Kimura\n(\n\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\n)\nMy opponent was Shohei, also known as\nZeen\n. He is a very well-known player while I showed up out of nowhere. As you can see, he had a team I was able to win against twice in Day 1. I was confident that\nI had good chances\nwinning my first-ever World Championships.\nGame 1 starts rough because I predicted him to Spore my Farigiraf slot. Otherwise he would faint to Phantom Force after a Psychic, even through the Terastallization. I was able to get back into a winning position but got flinched by Icicle Crash. I was not mad at all because he got me in turn 1, so he deserved the win. Game 2 started the same, I could click Ghost Tera Type-boosted Phantom Force to get into a great position. I know that he wouldn\u2019t Sucker Punch this turn but I predicted an Icicle Crash instead. With the Sword of Ruin active, I would be able to KO the Amoonguss, but he made a clever switch and clicked Spore into Dragapult once again. I tried my best coming back, but it was just not possible and\nhe won very deservedly\nwith a 2-0.\nConclusion\nI still can\u2019t believe that I have made it this far. I\u2019m so proud of myself and happy that I achieved my goal to show what newer players can be made of!\nHuge shoutout to the whole\nTub Nation\ngroup,\nGoblin\ngroup and the\nGerman\nelite.
