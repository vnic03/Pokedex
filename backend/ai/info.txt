vgc rules and rulesets





The list of permitted Pokémon changes with each Series. For the current format, Regulation Set A, the following Pokémon are allowed:

Paldea Pokédex: #001-375, #388-392


The list of permitted Pokémon changes with each Series. For Regulation Set B, the following Pokémon are allowed:

Paldea Pokédex: #001-392, #397-398
This allows the Paradox Pokémon (except Walking Wake and Iron Leaves), which could not be used in Regulation Set A.

Due to the connectivity with Pokémon GO, all Vivillon patterns except Poké Ball are now available.



The list of permitted Pokémon changes with each Series. For Regulation Set C, the following Pokémon are allowed:

Paldea Pokédex: #001-398
This allows the Treasures of Ruin, which could not be used in Regulation Set B.

Although connectivity with Pokémon HOME became available while this was the official ruleset, Pokémon coming from Pokémon HOME were still not allowed, so HOME-exclusive forms (such as Pikachu in a Cap or Gimmighoul Roaming Form) are still ineligible.





Paldea Pokédex: #001-398 (all Pokémon, including all Pikachu in a Cap, Poké Ball Pattern Vivillon and Roaming Form Gimmighoul; except for Koraidon and Miraidon).
Pokémon HOME-exclusive Pokémon: a select list of Pokémon species that is not regularly available in Paldea, but may be brought into the region through Pokémon HOME, is now legal. Check the table below.
